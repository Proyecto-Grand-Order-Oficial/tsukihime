<Page1>
I wake up, my thoughts still hazy.
My arm feels a little heavy as I reach out for my
glasses.
Ah, I must have developed a light fever. With that
detached thought, I put them on.
<Page2>
My vision returns to normal, but the mild dizziness
persists.
My symptoms resemble those of a cold, but this is one
of those fevers peculiar to the morning.
Like an engine that hasn't started up in a while being
warmed by combustion, this feeling will subside with
time.
<Page3>
There's a knock at the door.
After a short pause―――
<Page4>
"Pardon the intrusion."
With a bow, Hisui enters the room.
<Page5>
"Morning, Hisui. Thanks as always."
"Good morning, Shiki-sama. I see that you are already
awake."
<Page6>
"Yeah. I slept like a log last night. I'll head down to
the dining room as soon as I've gotten dressed.
...Can you let Kohaku-san know that since I have a
light fever, I'd like a smaller portion today?"
<Page7>
"Understood.
...Um, do you require a thermometer?"
"No, I don't. It's just your average low-grade fever."
<Page8>
"In that case, your change of clothes is over here. I
will wait for you in the dining room."
Hisui bows and leaves the room.
Perhaps it's just me, but her bow didn't seem as sharp
as usual.
<Page9>
"...I wonder if she's worried about me. However, this
kind of thing really does happen all the time."
<Page10>
I appreciate the concern, but it's nothing to make a
fuss over.
If you're going to fret about something, it should
be―――
―――a wound like that, one you can instantly tell is
serious.
<Page11>
"...But man, to think she really used duct tape for
that. Just looking at it made my blood run cold. Next
time I see her, I'll―――"
<Page12>
I cut myself short before I can finish my sentence.
There is no 'next time'.
We'll never see each other again.
You couldn't convince me to get involved with that
walking calamity of a woman again, not for all the
money in the world.
<Page13>
"...That's right. I decided that would be for the
best."
I digest that undeniable fact.
It's Monday.
The beginning of the week. A good chance to start
fresh.
<Page14>
Having washed my face and dressed myself, I enter the
living room.
Akiha is sitting on the sofa.
The clock has only just struck seven, but she seems to
have already finished her breakfast and is now
gracefully enjoying a cup of tea.
<Page15>
"Oh, good morning, Nii-san. You're up early today."
Akiha seems to be in a good mood, I wonder if it's
because she's pleased to see me up and about so early.
"Good morning. You seem to be up early as well, as per
usu―――"
<Page16>
And then...
I suddenly feel lightheaded, so I pinch the bridge of
my nose.
Even then, the dizziness won't go away.
My body temperature rises, so much so that even I start
to think something is wrong―――
<Page17>
"Nii-san...?"
I hear the faint rustling of clothes and the sound of
approaching footsteps.
<Page18>
"Is something wrong? Your face is red, do you have a
fever?"
"Ah... well, it's true I have a fever, but..."
<Page19>
Akiha moves up close to me and peers up into my face
from below.
...That's odd.
For some reason, when I look at her, it feels like my
dizziness gets even more intense.
<Page20>
"...It seems you have a bit of a fever.
Did you make sure to use your blanket last night? I'm
sure this is simply a result of the change in scenery
throwing your health a little off-balance, but let's
just check to be on the safe side.
Please wait here, Nii-san. I will call Kohaku over
right away, and we'll take your temperature before you
have breakfast."
<Page21>
Akiha turns her gaze to the lobby. She must be planning
to go and call for Kohaku-san, who is currently
preparing breakfast in the kitchen.
I take this opportunity to avert my gaze from Akiha.
...As I suspected, that was all it took to alleviate my
dizziness.
<Page22>
"It's okay, Akiha. You don't need to call Kohaku-san.
I simply wasn't feeling well because I just woke up, so
you don't need to be so worried―――"
<Page23>
"If you are not feeling well, then that is all the more
reason not to leave you alone. What are you going to do
if you catch a cold? Even a mild illness could pose a
serious threat to your health. Your natural immunity
and resilience are well below that of the average
person, after all."
<Page24>
Exasperated, Akiha places her hand on my forehead.
The sudden cool touch of her delicate palm sends a
shiver down the back of my neck.
<Page25>
"――――――"
For an instant, my breathing stops completely.
Akiha is right, there is something wrong with me this
morning.
I don't understand why, but every single move she makes
goes right to my head.
Just watching her is enough to make my body temperature
rise.
If I were to touch her directly, it'd probably make me
so dizzy that I'd collapse.
<Page26>
"...Nii-san? Um, you seem to be running quite a high
temperature...?"
I feel Akiha's voice echoing, not in my ears, but
directly inside my brain.
It was as if her beautiful black hair and her pale
porcelain skin had turned into heat, and were flowing
directly into my head.
<Page27>
"..."
This is bad.
This feeling will pass.
My body's just a little unstable as a result of all the
fatigue it's accumulated.
<Page28>
But, what I need to do right now, before I do something
unthinkable in front of Akiha, is―――
"Ah, I just remembered something urgent!"
I brush off her hand and run like the wind.
<Page29>
"Shiki-sama? Preparations for breakfast will still take
another five minutes or so..."
"Really? Thanks. Um, where's my bag?"
"If you're looking for your bag, it's right here."
<Page30>
Flawless preparation. That's Hisui for you.
I thank Hisui and take my bag from her.
"I'm off. I'll see myself out!"
<Page31>
"Stop right there! Where do you think you're going with
a fever like that, Nii-san!# First and foremost,
listening to your little sister and not running in the
corridors are the rules of this household! Settle down
and have your temperature checked in the living room at
once!"
<Page32>
Akiha is waiting for me in the lobby. She must have
come to try and stop me.
However, given that she's following her own rule about
not running in the corridors, it seems she's only just
made it here from the living room.
<Page33>
"My bad, I'll make sure to follow the rules next
time...!
My fever's gone down, so now I'm headed to school! I'll
sort something out for breakfast myself, so if you
could just look the other way this morning, that would
be great!"
<Page34>
"What do you mean you'll sort something out―――Wait,
Nii-san?!
Hold on, what did you just say?! A rule you'll follow
next time can hardly be called a rule at all!"
<Page35>
As though fleeing Akiha's reprimands, I run through the
entryway toward the front door of the mansion.
In my heart, I clasp my hands together in silent prayer
and apologize.
<Page36>
I appreciate that she's worried about my health, but
there's no way I could say something like,
'Well, the truth is, just looking at you is almost
enough to make me pass out.'
I can't even begin to imagine the retaliation that
would've been in store for me if I had.
<Page37>
"."
After taking a deep breath, I'm finally able to calm
down.
I should be safe now that I've put this much distance
between us.
Akiha isn't childish enough to announce 'I'm going to
school too!' and then chase after her older brother as
he legs it.
<Page38>
"But it really is typical of Akiha to be upset about
the rules, of all things."
Remembering what she said earlier brings a wry smile to
my lips.
Even though she's my sister, to this day I still can't
say for sure whether her emotional boiling point is
high or low.
<Page39>
"...I guess I should stop by a convenience store."
I don't have a lot of money in my wallet, but I should
at least get something light to eat.
<Page40>
I resent the fact that I actually have an appetite,
today of all days.
Normally, I wouldn't mind skipping breakfast, but I'm
pretty hungry this morning, so I've just got to suck it
up.
I'll pick up some stuffed bread, that should be enough
to tide me over until lunchtime.
