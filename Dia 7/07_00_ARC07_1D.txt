With classes over, the school day has come to a close#.
Yet, here I am wondering where the time went.
I was so caught up in all the dark thoughts swirling
around my head that I've only now noticed the fact I'm
alone in the classroom.
<Page2>
"...The serial killer... is still out there."
By all rights, those words shouldn't even warrant a
second thought.
But I recall her saying something.
'I have never killed a human being.'
I can't bring myself to believe she was lying.
<Page3>
"...Perhaps the news got it wrong. Or maybe―――"
The only one who knows for sure is Arcueid herself.
If I can track her down and see her once more, I'm sure
everything will be cleared up.
<Page4>
...But even I don't understand why I want to.
Those killings are no longer any of my concern.
<Page5>
My life returned to normal the moment I settled the
score with Vlov.
I fulfilled my duty. I must have.
That's why there's no reason. No reason to go out of my
way to set foot into such an abnormal world.
I should just carry on as normal, pretend nothing
happened and go home without thinking any more about
this.
<Page6>
Giving up and going home.
As choices go, that's definitely the runner-up.
But that's because a long time ago, someone taught me
the number one thing to do in a situation like this.
<Page7>
"―――Life is full of pitfalls for every human being.
But I know you've got what it takes to pull through, so
come on, show some resolve―――"
<Page8>
"...That's right.
There's no way I can just sit back and watch."
<Page9>
Those words saved me.
I lived my life by those words.
That's why I can't just stand back and turn a blind
eye.
<Page10>
...This case is far from over.
Having already gotten mixed up in it once, it seems I'm
now fated to see this troublesome matter all the way
through to the bitter end.
<Page11>
I leave the school grounds.
I don't have much of a lead, but I do still have the
apartment key she entrusted me with.
I'll head there first and see what I can find.
<Page12>
"She's... not here."
The apartment is just as I remember it, but Arcueid is
nowhere to be found.
She's not here, but I can at least sense a trace of her
presence in this room. I feel a wave of relief pass
over me at this assurance that she hasn't vanished into
thin air.
<Page13>
"That's fine. I didn't think finding her was going to
be that easy.
Alright, time to buckle up and get moving."
<Page14>
I could wait here, but there's no guarantee she's
coming back.
...I have no choice but to go out into the city and
search for her at random, just like the time I first
met her.
<Page15>
As the sun sets, the city dons its evening visage#.
I searched all over the most likely areas, but found
neither hide nor hair of Arcueid.
<Page16>
"...What's with that woman? When I'm not looking for
her, she wanders right by me, but at a time like this,
I can't spot her anywhere."
<Page17>
...What should I do?
The night has just begun. I should―――
C:> Return to the mansion and reassess the situation.
C:> Not give up, and keep searching the city.
