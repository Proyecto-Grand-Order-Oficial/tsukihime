I'll talk with Arcueid a little longer.
Even though I've decided to help exterminate the
vampire, there are still many things I don't know.
<Page2>
"No, my nausea hasn't subsided, so I'll stick around
until I'm feeling better. I've got some questions for
you as well, since we're here.
Patrolling the city may be off the table, but just
talking should be no problem, right?"
<Page3>
"R-Really? I'm up for it, but are you sure?
Don't humans usually get sleepy at this time of night?"
"It's no big deal. I've never been much good at
sleeping anyway."
<Page4>
"Not good at it... as in insomnia?"
"No, I can get to sleep just fine. I simply don't like
doing it."
"Hmm. You don't get any dreams?"
<Page5>
Dreams...?
...No.# I don't concern myself with such vagaries#.
<Page6>
"Anyway, I'll keep you company until midnight.
Although I can leave if you're getting tired of all the
talking."
<Page7>
"No, I'm not tired at all!
On the contrary, I'm raring to go!"
<Page8>
"...I-I see. I respect your enthusiasm, but please
don't get carried away and start roughhousing. No
punching the ground or anything like that."
<Page9>
"I wouldn't do something as pointless as that.
Geez, what kind of person do you take me for?! Are you
misunderstanding something again?!"
"Don't worry, I know exactly what to take you for. A
vampire who goes too far and doesn't know how to hold
back."
<Page10>
Now then, without further ado, I should throw some
questions her way.
What I want to ask her about is―――
C:> ...More details regarding vampires.
C:> ...What are the Twenty-Seven Ancestors?
C:> ...Those clothes she wore when fighting Vlov.
