The hands of the clock reach their zenith.
While we were chatting away, the time mercilessly
advanced on the midnight hour we'd agreed would signal

"Oh, it looks like the date's rolled over.
It's a shame, but I've got to go get some rest soon."

"That's what you think. Let's call it here for tonight.
Besides, we still have tomorrow to look forward to."

"―――What the hell was that face just now?"
...It looked far too mischievous.
If she gives me a smile like that, there's no way I can
break my promise―――
