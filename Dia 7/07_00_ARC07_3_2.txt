I don't feel sleepy yet, but it seems like my body
needs some rest.
Today has been a very eventful day.
Besides, one could say that I've been dragged around by
her since the evening began.
<Page2>
"...You're right. I should definitely get going soon."
"I suppose so. You must be tired after all,# plus you
have that scary little sister of yours to deal with,
don't you?"
"No, she's not scary at all."
<Page3>
I do still have to face her sooner or later though.
But besides that...
<Page4>
"So, what's the plan for tomorrow? Where do you want to
meet?"
"We can meet here. Ten o'clock sharp. Don't forget to
bring your knife with you."
<Page5>
Well, that goes without saying.
As if I would go around searching for vampires unarmed.
<Page6>
"But ten o'clock..."
The mansion's lights are turned off at nine-thirty, and
it's prohibited for anyone to enter or leave after ten.
It'll be hard to sneak out of the mansion behind Hisui
and Kohaku-san's backs.
I almost suggest pushing the time back to eleven
o'clock, but figure I'll just make it work somehow.
<Page7>
After all, the night is shorter than it seems.
The more time we have searching together, the better.
<Page8>
"That's great. Okay then, Shiki.
I'll see you here again tomorrow."
<Page9>
"――――――"
What happened to the troublemaking attitude she's had
all day?
Having said her farewells in such an incredibly gentle
tone of voice, she takes her leave.
<Page10>
"...What the hell. So you can do it after all."
I grumble as though to distract myself from the
feelings that have welled up in my chest.
Shit...
I don't think I can forget our promise if she gives me
a smile like that.
