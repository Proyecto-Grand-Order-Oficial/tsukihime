The minute the bell rings for lunch,# this degenerate
reappears, yawning as though he's only just woken up.
<Page2>
"～. That was a great nap.
Tohno, let's go get a bite to eat."
<Page3>
What a guy. I've got a hunch that the only three things
bouncing around in that skull of his are sleep, food,
and sex.
<Page4>
"Sure, I'm obviously ready to go eat, but are you
really okay with that? Me being your lunch date, that
is. I thought you were dead set on getting Senpai to
accompany you?"
"Huh? Lunch with Senpai?"
<Page5>
Arihiko frowns, his expression souring.
Looks like Senpai gave him the cold shoulder again
today.
<Page6>
I go and get lunch with Arihiko.
Having slept his fill in the infirmary―――
"Looking up the area in front of Souya Station... Hmm,
there doesn't seem to be anything new."
He's now hard at work hunting for information, mobile
phone in hand.
It's like they say, 'Trailing behind society by even
four hours can prove fatal'.
<Page7>
It could also just be a case of internet addiction, but
it's Arihiko we're talking about. He's a different
breed from the other students.
Keeping up to date with what happened at Souya Station
isn't just Arihiko amusing himself with other people's
affairs. He's earnestly checking for anything that will
give him an edge when it comes to surviving the
nighttime world of the business district.
<Page8>
"Hmm, looks like there's been another garden variety
cash register robbery.
The shop clerk got stabbed in the gut, looks like the
perp was an alcoholic. Yikes, that's gotta hurt.
There's no reasoning with a drunk, is there? I guess
shopping online really is the safest way to play it."
<Page9>
Arihiko demolishes his meal, browsing his phone with
his other hand all the while.
The tradition of a father reading the newspaper during
mealtime has completely transformed into its modern-day
equivalent right in front of me.
No, leaving that modern-day critique aside.
<Page10>
"Arihiko, is reading about this sort of news during
lunch really that much fun?"
"It's not fun at all. But for the sake of my foolish
friend who takes no interest in the outside world, I
have no choice but to inform him of the dangers of
society.
Are you hearing all this, Tohno-kun? The north gate
collapsed, a drunkard stabbed someone, and an
indiscriminate serial killer is on the loose. It's not
like we're completely unaffected by this stuff,
y'know."
<Page11>
"You're right. Though, that string of serial killings
is over now.
I'll grant you the incident at the north gate, but
apart from that, things are the same as they always
were."
<Page12>
"Really? They caught the serial killer?"
"Well, they didn't exactly catch him, but―――"
<Page13>
The culprit is no longer of this world.
That's why there aren't any news stories with vulgar
headlines about modern-day vampires, nor are there
people being meaninglessly murdered by them.
<Page14>
"In any case, those kinds of silly incidents won't
happen again, and there won't be any more victims. The
city is back to normal now."
"...Hmm. I dunno, I think there's gonna be more
victims, Tohno."
<Page15>
"No, there won't. What makes you so sure, anyway?"
"I mean, look. The news just reported that the ninth
victim was discovered this morning."
<Page16>
Arihiko shows me the screen of his phone.
<Page17>
"―――――#Huh?"
I can't believe my eyes.
It's just as he said. There, on a news aggregator
website, under a heading consisting of a bird's-eye
view of the Souya Station north gate, is new
information regarding the vampire serial killings.
<Page18>
"You've got to be kidding. Isn't this around the back
of the theater we always go to?"
"Hold on. Let me see that again."
<Page19>
I borrow the phone from Arihiko.
This isn't some troll spreading misinformation, nor is
it unsubstantiated speculation.
The screen clearly shows an official statement from the
police, announcing that the serial killer's ninth
victim was discovered last night.
<Page20>
"No way―――"
I'm at a loss for words.
That guy――Vlov――is dead. I killed him with my own
two hands.
So then why... Why are corpses with their blood sucked
dry still appearing...?!
<Page21>
"Still, a modern-day vampire, huh?# Although I guess I
wouldn't mind having my blood sucked if the vampire was
a beautiful older woman."
"A beautiful... vampire?"
<Page22>
My spine freezes at Arihiko's casual remark.
'I wouldn't mind having my blood sucked if the vampire
was a beautiful woman.'
I can't take these playful words as a mere joke.
<Page23>
"The incident... isn't over yet―――"
The appearance of new victims proves that the vampire
is still alive and well.
...A simple process of elimination is all that's
needed.
Vlov is gone.
That means the only other remaining vampire is―――
