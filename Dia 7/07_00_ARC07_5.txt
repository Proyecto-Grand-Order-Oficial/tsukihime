I've returned to the mansion. Since it's the middle of
the night, there's not a single light on inside.
The front door is unlocked.
<Page2>
"...Hisui. She really left it open for me."
I let out a sigh of gratitude.
I enter the mansion, treading gingerly so as not to
wake Akiha or Kohaku-san.
<Page3>
"―――."
I take a deep breath and sit on the bed.
My body is absolutely exhausted, just as she'd said.
I collapse onto the bed as though I were being sucked
into it.
<Page4>
"......."
Lying there, I let out a deep breath.
...My promise with Arcueid.
Perhaps it was fate that led me down such a dangerous
path once again.
<Page5>
"...But there was no other way. I couldn't just leave
her be."
Or perhaps I didn't want her to do it alone.
I didn't want to allow someone as miraculously
beautiful as her, someone who isn't human, to have to.

"――――――"
I'm acting like a fool. I already killed her with my
own hands once, what am I getting so worked up about?
I'm only lending her a hand with the vampire
extermination to protect this city. If I don't, then
some harm might befall me, so I have no choice but to
cooperate. That's all.
<Page7>
"...That's right. Why else would I be doing this?"
<Page8>
...I close my eyes.
...I take off my glasses.
I surrender myself to the enveloping hand of weariness,
and allow it to drag my body and consciousness down
into the dark abyss of sleep.
<Page9>
...I've decided to help Arcueid out once more.
For now, I'll clear my mind of anything unnecessary and
prepare myself for tomorrow――――
