Arcueid cuts through the city nightlife.
An unwavering white silhouette with fluttering gold
hair.
That figure is the same one I saw when I first laid
eyes on her.
Or perhaps it's closer to how she looked as she faced
down Vlov, standing tall amidst the crumbling wreckage.
<Page2>
The conflicting feelings I'd been wrestling with up
until now vanish.
There's no doubt in my mind now. The figure ahead of me
is the platonic ideal of a huntress.
<Page3>
"Arcueid."
"――――――"
Without so much as a glance back at me, Arcueid just
keeps walking.
<Page4>
"Hey, listen to me. Where do you think you're going?"
"――――――"
<Page5>
The woman in white does not stop.
...It'd be pathetic if I were to give up on trying to
get through to her after coming this far.
It'd be pathetic, but... For now, I'll just hold my
tongue and follow after her.
<Page6>
.  . .
Our wordless march continues, punctuated only by the
sound of our footsteps.
―――Until.
Arcueid abruptly stops in her tracks and glares over
her shoulder at me.
<Page7>
"Stop following me. An ordinary human such as yourself
will only get in my way, can't you understand that?"
<Page8>
"Sorry for being human. If you tell me what you're
doing, I promise I'll get out of your hair."
"...It has nothing to do with you, so scram."
<Page9>
Arcueid faces forward and resumes walking in a huff.
...Great.
Looks like I'm in for more taciturn prowling around the
city.
<Page10>
We've left the city's downtown area behind us, and are
approaching a deserted railway underpass when Arcueid
stops dead in her tracks.
<Page11>
"―――Found one."
"Huh...?"
Arcueid's voice was cold, like it belonged to a
completely different person.
<Page12>
"――――."
...A shiver runs down my spine.
All I can see from back here is her posture, but even
that is enough for me to sense the scale of the
murderous aura that now envelops her.
<Page13>
"―――What are you――"
――planning on doing? I start to ask, but fall silent.
I know what she's about to do, even without hearing it
put into words.
What emanates from Arcueid right now is an unmistakable
'murderous intent'.
<Page14>
"Hey―――What are you thinking? You...!"
"――――"
Arcueid does not respond.
Her gaze is trained on an average-looking man in a
business suit as he walks along.
<Page15>
"Shiki. Take off your glasses and look at that human."
"That human... you mean that man over there?"
<Page16>
"Hurry up.
If you want to know what I'm doing, then save your
questions for later."
"...Fine. Although I don't really like taking them off
in town―――"
<Page17>
I take off my glasses.
"......"
A light headache pulses in my temple.
And in exchange for that pain, I faintly see the
'lines' of the walls and the ground.
<Page18>
"Just checking, but are you able to clearly make out
those 'lines' of yours on living beings?"
"...Yeah. They're much more visible on living creatures
than on inanimate objects."
<Page19>
"As I suspected. You're a living being after all, you
wouldn't be able to comprehend the 'death' of something
inorganic.
The shape of it is only the first step. Even if you're
able to perceive the 'outcomes' that result from
processes of wear and tear, you still wouldn't be able
to see the 'end' of an inanimate object. The only way
you could would be to share the same perspective, the
same value system as those objects.
...If you want to 'perceive' death, you have to be able
to 'comprehend' life first."
<Page20>
"So with all that said―――Shiki, when you look at
that human, what do you see?"
"Hmm?"
I don't think there's anything particularly odd―――
<Page21>
"――――!?"
 I reflexively take a step back.
<Page22>
...What the hell... is that?
It's true that any human would have those 'lines'.
Except normally, there are few enough that you can
easily count them, even as they slowly shift like
flowing geometric patterns.
<Page23>
But this―――what the hell is this?
The 'lines' race across the entirety of his body. They
smear themselves across him from head to foot, making
it look as though all his veins and arteries have
floated to the surface. I can't even make out what the
man looks like underneath them all.
<Page24>
"――――."
I feel like throwing up.
...That thing goes against everything I know. It isn't
a man with lines of death, but lines of death that have
taken on the appearance of a man.
<Page25>
"What do you see, Shiki? To be honest, I would have
preferred it if all you could see was a normal human
being."
<Page26>
"........."
I can't even muster a response to Arcueid's words.
Right now, it's taking all I've got just to stop myself
from throwing up.
<Page27>
"―――I see.
I feel bad for you. To think that you can even see the
lines of death on a thing like that."
"Ah... it's different... from usual... but... I can
see... the lines..."
<Page28>
"As I thought. So you can even kill the Dead.
The question of whether something is alive or not is
irrelevant. If it moves, if it can be destroyed, then
you have the ability to end it. No exceptions.
―――How absurd. Doesn't that make you the real
monster here?"
"Wha―――――"
<Page29>
"As you can see, that thing can no longer be called
human.
It's a being that uses the blood of others to
continuously cheat that debt we call death―――a
vampire."
<Page30>
Arcueid sets off at a brisk pace.
She makes a beeline for the ordinary-looking man.
<Page31>
"Wait, Arcueid―――"
"Stay where you are, Shiki."
<Page32>
Maybe the man noticed Arcueid coming for him, as in the
blink of an eye he vanished from my field of view.
Though, rather than simply vanishing, it'd be more
accurate to say that he skittered away at superhuman
speed.
<Page33>
As though trying to hide, the man flees into the
darkness of the underpass.
Arcueid is nowhere to be seen.
She too has stepped out from under the illumination of
the rusting streetlamps, and into the darkness so deep
as to be impenetrable to the human eye.
<Page34>
―――.
The pounding of my heart sounds uncomfortably close.
<Page35>
The night is still young.
The headlights of a passing car.
The sound of a train thundering overhead.
Despite being at the center of this cacophony, I cannot
feel the presence of a single person other than myself.
<Page36>
―――.
My glasses―――I need to put my glasses back on, and
quickly.
If I don't, I'll end up seeing something unpleasant.
I'll end up staring straight into the abyss, one so
deep as to make everything I've seen up to this point
pale in comparison.
<Page37>
―――.
But my body won't move.
My unfettered eyes, able to perceive the threadbare
nature of this run-down world, are drawn as though
entranced to the dark void Arcueid vanished into, and I
gaze, transfixed, across that threshold of darkness.
<Page38>
"―――――――"
Suddenly, silence falls.
From the sound of the wind,
to the scent of the ground.
Everything abruptly freezes in place.
<Page39>
――――――.
The world beneath the moon reaches absolute zero.
From somewhere near the limits of my perception, there
emanates an unfamiliar sound.
<Page40>
――――――.
There's no way I should be able to see it,
and there's no way the sound should be able to reach
me.
<Page41>
――――――.
And yet, I saw it.
The sound of death clashing against death―――there's
no question that these eyes could discern it.
<Page42>
"――――"
My vision is stained crimson.
Why―――Why can these eyes perceive the 'death' of
something that I shouldn't even be able to see?
<Page43>
"――――"
My glasses.
If I don't put on my glasses, I'm going to lose my
mind.
Fighting back the urge to vomit that's welling up in my
throat, I put my glasses back on with trembling hands.
<Page44>
Light and sound return.
Getting a firm grip on myself, I take a good look at my
surroundings and see nothing but an ordinary underpass.
<Page45>
There's nobody around, and there aren't many cars, but
this is still a wholly unremarkable nighttime scene in
the city.
This is a place without danger, a place where danger
cannot even be allowed to exist, the sphere of
civilization that humans call home.
<Page46>
"―――――――"
My breathing is ragged.
Even though I'm wearing my glasses, there are still
afterimages of the 'death' from earlier lingering in
the corners of my eyes. It gives me the creeps.
<Page47>
"Ar...cueid?"
With faltering footsteps, Arcueid emerges from the
darkness, her breathing even more labored than my own.
<Page48>
"Shiki...? I see, so you're still here."
With a seemingly embarrassed look on her face, she
hurries past me, lurching as she does so.
Her gait is feeble, like that of an invalid.
<Page49>
―――Truth be told, my own nausea still has yet to
subside.
But with Arcueid visibly in pain right in front of me,
all other thoughts are pushed aside.
<Page50>
"Hold on. What in the world happened to you?!"
I grab hold of Arcueid's shoulder as she attempts to
leave.
With vacant eyes, she slowly turns to look at me.
<Page51>
"I'm fine. I'm just feeling a bit tired, nothing to be
worried about.
―――Besides, this has absolutely nothing to do with
you."
<Page52>
"You idiot. If you're tired, then rest...!
You're dripping with sweat, and it's clear at first
glance that you're seriously wounded...!?"
Panting as I fight to control my breathing, I grab hold
of her arm.
<Page53>
"...What the hell. You say that, but you look as though
you're about to collapse yourself."
"That's just my anemia acting up, it's nothing unusual.
If you can afford to worry about others, then worry
about yourself as well."
<Page54>
"―――It's fine. Even if you're worried about me, it's
pointless."
Arcueid's breathing is so faint that my heart aches for
her.
<Page55>
"Don't tell me―――The wound from that time―――"
I couldn't bring myself to finish asking whether it had
healed yet.
I mean, she got that wound protecting me after all.
<Page56>
"―――――"
Her head still hung low, Arcueid doesn't answer.
That silence is not denial, but confirmation... I
think.
<Page57>
"Goddamnit, how many times do I have to say this, you
idiot!
Your body is a wreck, are you incapable of just taking
things easy for a bit!?"
".... I was... taking it easy... though."
"The hell you were! And don't tell me that it's fine
because you're not human, there's nobody alive that
could go wandering around with an open wound like
that!"
<Page58>
I notice that I'm genuinely angry, and come to a
realization.
...I can't leave her be.
This woman truly is an unbelievable pain in the ass,
but in the end, I just can't leave her alone.
<Page59>
"...What the hell were you thinking?
Come on, don't just sit there, answer me. I'm not
letting go until you talk to me!"
<Page60>
I grasp both of her white shoulders.
Arcueid still doesn't look up, but I think I can make
out a faint nod.
<Page61>
"...Geez. You're a rather persistent one, aren't you?
I'll talk, but let's get out of here first. It seems
like that guy from earlier was a dud anyway."
<Page62>
Arcueid brushes off my arm and does an about-face.
It seems that her destination is not the downtown area,
but the deserted park.
