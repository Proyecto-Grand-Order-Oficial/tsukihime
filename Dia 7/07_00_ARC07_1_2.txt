I'll keep searching the city.
That's how we first met, after all―――a chance
encounter.
Our relationship isn't so straightforward as to have a
designated meetup location.
And if it turns out I can't rely on chance, then I'll
just have to put my own legs and intuition to work and
seek out that white figure of hers.
<Page2>
"...That's right. That's what it really means to go and
meet a person. We rely on our phones too much."
<Page3>
That's how it was back before mobile phones became so
widespread.
Even if you couldn't find each other where you'd
planned to meet up, if you considered the other
person's lifestyle and thought patterns, you could seek
them out using your wits alone.
It's like a 'sixth sense', an innate human ability that
we just take for granted. Even in this day and age,
reliant as we are on our cell phones, there's nothing
we can't do if we set our minds to it.
<Page4>
...Though, I can only cover so much ground.
The residential district or the business district... I
wonder which I'd be better off focusing on.
<Page5>
"......Alright."
After a brief moment of thought, I settle on the
business district.
In addition to patrolling between the north and south
gates of Souya Station, I'll extend my route over
toward that side of the city.
<Page6>
No matter how thick the crowds may be, if she's still
in this city―――if her retreating figure is still
somewhere in that crowd―――I absolutely will not let
it slip away.
<Page7>
"There's no way."
'Sixth sense' my ass.
'Maybe she'll be right around the corner?'
'This time she's definitely in front of the station!'
All my hunches and hopes inevitably ended in
disappointment.
<Page8>
I can't remember the last time I went on such a
refreshing fool's errand. I might even go so far as to
say this is a first.
I suppose the reason for that is because I never knew
when my anemia might flare up; I've always been careful
to avoid meaningless exertion as best I could.
<Page9>
...So then, why did I choose to do something like this?
To hare off after her, on the back of nothing more
substantial than the thought that 'maybe there's a
chance', or 'what if I can find her'.
<Page10>
"But the night is only just beginning.
I'll just search around for a little longer―――"
<Page11>
I receive a message on my phone.
Who could it be? Arihiko, perhaps? I take out my phone
and...
<Page12>
"Shiki-san,
could you please return to the mansion as quickly as
possible?
I ask because an unexpected guest has arrived."
<Page13>
"She's a beautiful woman from abroad, and claims to be
your girlfriend?
Your failure to return home, combined with your
behavior this morning, has put Akiha-sama in a rather
foul mood.
What is the meaning of all this?"
<Page14>
A cryptic email from Kohaku-san.
"―――#Huh?"
My mind goes blank.
Does this mean... At this very moment, Arcueid is at
the Tohno mansion?
I can easily see this going horribly wrong, but my
brain refuses to even comprehend the possible
ramifications.
<Page15>
I was naïve. I truly was.
Why on earth did I think that Arcueid's actions would
obey any kind of common sense?
<Page16>
"How much more unpredictable could you possibly get?!"
I sprint for the mansion with all the energy I can
muster.
<Page17>
It's terrifying to imagine what Arcueid might be saying
right now.
The only thing worse would be what's going through
Akiha's mind as she listens to her. If I even start to
think about that, I'll lose the will to live!
<Page18>
Nice. I beat my personal best.
Having run all the way up the grueling hill, I arrive
at the Tohno residence out of breath.
However...
<Page19>
"...."
My breathing, ragged from sprinting here at full speed,
calms down.
My heaving shoulders come to a standstill.
<Page20>
Little wonder. The mansion exudes the same heavy sense
of dread you'd feel during the opening scene of a
horror movie.
Or rather...
<Page21>
"Well, you came at just the right time.
I hope you've prepared yourself, Nii-san."
<Page22>
...Hold on.
Was it always this easy for humans to be pressured into
willingly accepting their own deaths?
<Page23>
However, there is no path of escape for an older
brother.
If I falter here, the situation will only continue to
get worse.
I strengthen my resolve and rush headlong into the
lion's den.
<Page24>
"It seems you have finally arrived.
.... If you had arrived even a minute later, I
don't know what would have happened."
