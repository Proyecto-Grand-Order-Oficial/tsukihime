"That hurts. Suddenly dragging me outside like that,
have you lost your mind?"
That has to be the least self-aware complaint of all
time.
<Page2>
"Have  lost  mind? What are you trying to pull
here!? Waltzing right up to the mansion like that isn't
exactly sane behavior! Don't tell me you're
intentionally trying to ruin my life, you stupid
woman!"
<Page3>
"S...Stupid woman? Are you trying to make fun of me?!"
"I'm just calling an idiot an idiot, that's all there
is to it, you moron! If you have any objections then
let's hear them, I'm all ears!"
"Huh? Ah... wha?"
<Page4>
I've hit my boiling point.
I've never been in such an inexplicable predicament
before, I'm not going to be able to calm down without
giving her a piece of my mind.
<Page5>
"What's the big deal, I just came here to see you.
I don't think I did anything that justifies getting so
worked up."
"...You just came to see me? Arcueid, are you being
serious right now?"
<Page6>
"Y-Yeah, I am. What about it?
B-Besides, there weren't any problems. I didn't use my
Mystic Eyes, I approached them just like a normal human
would.
I even kept quiet about your eyes and the fact that I'm
a vampire in front of your sister, since I know that's
important to you."
<Page7>
"That much I know without being told. Even someone like
you has enough common sense to not bring that up."
<Page8>
"...You really are a mystery.
In that case, what are you so upset about?"
<Page9>
"It's because of how little you think things through!
Do you need me to spell it out for you!? Think about
your surroundings and who might be watching. Have some
self-awareness about your appearance!
I'm begging you, please try to be a bit more discreet!
You draw too much attention to yourself just by
existing!"
<Page10>
....
I feel refreshed now that I've gotten everything off my
chest.
Arcueid, on the contrary, looks like she has a lot she
wants to say.
Like an indignant cat, she glares at me with a sullen
scowl on her face.
<Page11>
"―――What's up with you, mouthing off to me like
that?
Besides, what do you mean I stand out just by existing?
My outward appearance is no different to that of a
human being, right?"
"A beauty like you will stand out no matter what. It
has nothing to do with whether you're human or not."
<Page12>
I answer her clearly.
Perhaps because my reply left little room for debate,
Arcueid seems to have accepted it without a fuss.
<Page13>
"...Well, I'll admit I went too far.
I've never been caught in the ring between two
heavyweights like that before, so I got a bit
flustered."
<Page14>
"...It's fine. Besides, it seems I'm the one at fault
here."
Arcueid nods rather obediently.
Now that all's said and done, I start to feel a little
guilty about thinking she had some sinister ulterior
motive.
<Page15>
"...So. Why did you come all the way here?
Actually, I had something I wanted to ask you as well,
so I guess this is a blessing in disguise."
<Page16>
"Oh, really? I only stopped by because I was wondering
what you might be up to."
"I see. So you were just curious. Next time, hide
behind a tree when you come to spy on me. Do your best
to make sure that nobody's able to spot you. If you
hide so well even I can't spot you, all the better."
<Page17>
...I feel somewhat tired all of a sudden.
Well, this isn't the first time I've been jerked around
as a result of her whims.
At least she didn't let slip anything about the
situation to Akiha. I suppose that in her own way she's
doing the best she can to respect my position.
<Page18>
"Anyway, there's something important I need to ask you.
I won't be able to relax if we stick around here
though, so is it alright if we head somewhere else?"
<Page19>
"Sure, but―――what's this all about?"
"You'll know soon enough... Hmm, the park should be
pretty deserted by now, that might be our best bet."
<Page20>
I call out to her, signaling our departure, and begin
to walk.
Tilting her head to the side, Arcueid obediently falls
in line behind me.
