<Page1>
We've returned to the park.
Arcueid must have recuperated while we walked, as she's
now back to her usual self.
<Page2>
"Talk about a speedy recovery... There's no chance all
that really was just because you let your guard down
and got wounded, right?"
"Huh...? No, I was telling the truth when I said that I
was still recovering."
<Page3>
"...You told me the truth, hmm?
Yet haven't you also told me lies?"
". What's with that tone? You're being extremely
unpleasant, you know."
<Page4>
"Only because you've been acting so damn suspicious.
If you have a problem with it, then start by explaining
what happened back there.
I think I get the big picture, but how did you end up
in so much pain?"
<Page5>
"......
Well then! Without further ado, allow me to explain
what I was up to, as requested!"
<Page6>
"........."
What a brazen way to change the subject...
Well, this is what I really wanted to know about
anyway.
I'll circle back on her physical condition later.
<Page7>
"Alright, let me confirm something first.
That guy from earlier, he was one of those Dead that
act as a vampire's worker drones, wasn't he?
Which means the one controlling him is your real enemy,
correct?"
"Oh my. You're rather quick on the uptake today,
Shiki."
<Page8>
"Why thank you. Even I can put two and two together
after all. I think I have a pretty good handle on what
was going on earlier."
<Page9>
"Yeah. Marvelous. Splendid.
It seems the only cute misunderstanding of yours was
about Vlov."
"Don't call it cute... And cut me some slack, alright.
At the time, I had my hands full just dealing with my
own problems."
<Page10>
"Hmm. You had your hands full with your own problems,
huh.
Well, let's just leave it at that."
<Page11>
Seemingly amused, Arcueid twirls around and peers at my
face... It makes me a little uncomfortable.
<Page12>
"That's enough, now talk... That man from earlier, he
was already long dead, wasn't he?"
<Page13>
"That's right. He was an underling belonging to that
guy, so I disposed of him.
He was just a low-rank Dead, but if I left him alone
he'd end up killing humans and accumulate power.
Shiki, do you remember the conversation we had about
vampires back at the hotel?"
<Page14>
Of course, I nod back.
...The ecology of vampires.
Suzerains and how they make use of their minions...
<Page15>
Those vampires grow their clans by hunting humans,
killing them, and then turning them into underlings
known as the Dead. That done, they conceal themselves
and leave the work of collecting blood to their
underlings.
I remember Arcueid referring to them as 'Suzerains', or
the 'traditional type'.
Vampires that fit the stereotype of being immortal and
weak to sunlight.
<Page16>
"You've already taught me a bit about them.
...So, this vampire you're going after now, you're
certain they're the one behind the serial killings?"
<Page17>
"Yeah, I'm sure of it.
Even if he was only directly involved in the first one,
all the subsequent murders committed by his Dead can
still be ascribed to him.
That's why―――"
<Page18>
"That's why you were wandering the city like that, you
were searching for these underlings.
Are you able to locate the sire just by doing that...?"
<Page19>
"If the underlings have a strong enough bond with their
'sire', then yes. They've been nothing but duds so far
though.
His coffin... The only reason I haven't been able to
find his hiding place is because of how many Dead he's
using."
<Page20>
"That guy only had to dirty his hands a couple of
times. After that, all he had to do was puppet the
people he's turned into Dead and he can expand his
territory while he sleeps.
There have already been over a hundred victims in this
city.
The victims that you people are fussing over are only a
small fraction of those that are actually missing."
<Page21>
"――――"
...Yet again, I hear something that makes my blood run
cold.
Two days ago, I thought Vlov was the one responsible.
Because of that, I channeled this feeling toward the
sole aim of killing him. In doing so, I was able to
maintain my spiritual equilibrium.
<Page22>
But I no longer can.
This tragedy is still ongoing.
Over a hundred victims. Over a hundred people attacked,
drained of their blood, and finally killed by those
things that were once their fellow humans.
<Page23>
Those victims that have their blood sucked then become
new monsters in turn. Ambulant corpses, just like that
mass of lines from earlier, that go on to prowl the
city―――
<Page24>
Three days ago.
I remember all the people staying at the hotel whose
lives were extinguished.
Even though I was there, I didn't witness that scene
unfold in its entirety.
As a result, I could only imagine it in words, I
couldn't viscerally feel the extent of the horrifying
violence that had taken place.
<Page25>
The same is true now.
Even though I've just been told a vampire that sucks
the blood of humans is slowly expanding their dominion
in this city, it's not enough to provoke any emotions
in me.
<Page26>
―――However.
What if―――without meaning, and without
warning―――someone close to me was killed like
that... How would I feel then?
<Page27>
...I imagine it for only a single moment, realizing the
immorality behind such a thought.
I picture Akiha's body, sucked of its blood and
discarded like so much garbage.
<Page28>
"―――――――――"
The feeling of vertigo, as though my brain were being
slowly whittled away, gives way to exhaustion.
My heart, which ought to have been burning with
indignation, is strangely calm.
<Page29>
I tell myself that now is the time to think, not to
tremble.
I'm cognizant of the fact that under these
circumstances, such an event could still happen at any
time.
I can beat myself up over my stupidity for not
realizing we're still in danger some other time.
<Page30>
"I was afraid you'd get angry like this, Shiki.
That's why I didn't want to tell you... It isn't
something that the hunted―――that humans can do
anything about.
I'm sure that in your eyes, the behavior of vampires is
unacceptable."
<Page31>
Of course it is. I couldn't define for you the border
between good and evil, or right and wrong.
But even so, I can say with certainty that I feel this
is something I cannot abide.
<Page32>
Even people whose faces I don't know have lived their
lives and accumulated a past. And in proportion to that
past, they each still have some amount of future
remaining to them.
Even if that future has nothing to do with me, or is
something I can't even begin to comprehend, I can't
cast it aside so easily.
<Page33>
...I wouldn't want to be killed for sport like that
either.
Such a death would be far too frustrating. Such a death
would be far too lamentable.
Such a death―――would be far, far too meaningless.
<Page34>
"But you don't have to worry, Shiki.
It doesn't seem like vampires have any natural enemies
in this country, but luckily for you, I'm here now.
I mentioned this before, didn't I? My objective is to
exterminate the vampire that's invading this city."
<Page35>
I don't know what happened to her dispassionate
demeanor from earlier, but Arcueid has done a complete
180 and is now quite chipper.
I have to say, her words are reassuring.
I'm aware of how amazing she is, and the lengths she'll
go to in order to protect human life.
She defended the city against Vlov's cold waves with no
regard for her own safety.
<Page36>
...But there's something that just doesn't make sense
to me about that.
Right up until we fought Vlov, I harbored doubts about
her, as any human would.
<Page37>
"...I don't get it.
You're a vampire yourself, aren't you? Why are you
acting like some sort of ally of humanity?"
<Page38>
"It's not like I'm trying to side with humans or
anything.
I'm just doing it because I have nothing better to do."
"Huh?"
She has... nothing better to do...?
<Page39>
"Well, some people do have it out for me as a result
though. I guess that's―――what do you call
it―――the cost of doing business?"
"...No. I haven't the faintest idea what you're trying
to say, but I'm pretty sure that's not the phrase
you're looking for."
<Page40>
"Now, now, don't sweat the small stuff.
Despite the fact that a lot of people hate me and are
out to get me, you still helped me take down Vlov,
right? With him gone, there's nothing left to get in my
way."
<Page41>
"All that's left now is to find the 'enemy' hiding in
this city, and then I should have no trouble disposing
of them one way or another.
You can just go back to your ordinary life now, there's
no longer any reason for you to be mixed up in all
this."
<Page42>
"Ah―――yeah. That's great, but―――"
But―――are you really going to be okay on your own?
Those words surface in my mind, but I shake my head to
drive them off.
<Page43>
...What's wrong with me?
Why do I feel so guilty about making her take on such a
dangerous task alone?
<Page44>
"........."
"Shiki? What's wrong, why are you making such a serious
face again?
That answers your question, doesn't it? I don't think
there's anything left to discuss."
<Page45>
...You're wrong. There are still a ton of things I want
to ask you, but more importantly―――
<Page46>
"...You idiot, of course I'm making a serious face.
This is a situation that impacts the city we live in."
<Page47>
"Like I said, you don't have to worry about it.
From now on, I'll be patrolling the city every day,
keeping an eye out to make sure that there aren't any
more victims.
Or are you saying that you don't have any faith in my
abilities?"
<Page48>
I'll admit that I don't really want to get involved.
But those words...
I'm the one who lives here, so I should be the one
stepping up to say that I'll protect the city, not
Arcueid―――
<Page49>
"...Arcueid. Um... is this 'enemy' of yours strong?
Stronger than someone like Vlov?"
"No way. Despite his appearance, Vlov was still a
member of the Ancestors.
Compared to him, the vampire lurking in this city is of
a much lower purity."
"I see. Then he shouldn't pose much of a threat to you,
right?"
<Page50>
"I can't say for sure. If we were talking about me from
a couple of days ago, it'd be no problem, but right now
I'm still recuperating. There's a high chance that the
enemy is now more powerful than me."
.........
<Page51>
Wait, hold up, I was just nodding along without really
listening.
Arcueid is... recuperating...?
<Page52>
"Back up. Did you catch a cold or something?!
Scratch that, can vampires even catch colds?!"
<Page53>
"Of course, I caught a bad case of homicidal maniac
myself.
I believe it's caused by a malignant virus called
'Tohno Shiki', does that name ring any bells?"
"Ah―――well, that is, um... sorry."
I just stirred up a hornet's nest.
<Page54>
"I'm kidding. The wounds you gave me have already
healed. Though, despite that I still get tired if I end
up having to use more energy than I bargained for.
What hurts are the wounds I got from Vlov. Those are
still in the process of closing up."
<Page55>
Arcueid gently caresses her abdomen.
―――That wound too.
A needless injury she sustained because she was
protecting me.
<Page56>
"―――――"
I'm speechless.
I'm the root cause of everything that's ailing Arcueid.
So how...
How can she continue to smile so unguardedly at me,
without so much as a trace of reproach―――
<Page57>
"...That's enough. You should find somewhere to rest
for a bit, at least until your wounds have healed. It's
not as though taking a day or two off is going to make
much of a difference at this point, right?"
<Page58>
"I can't do that. Thanks to our fight with Vlov, it's
extremely likely the enemy has caught wind that I'm
here. If I were to take a break now, it would only
serve to let them know that I'm weak."
<Page59>
"...I guess, but do you really plan on keeping this up,
night after night?"
"Yeah. Since I don't know where he's hiding, all I can
do is pick off and destroy the Dead that are sending
him blood, one by one.
Once I've cut off his supply of blood, he'll be forced
to come out into the open in order to replenish it
himself."
<Page60>
"But what would you do if that were to happen
tomorrow?!
Even if you hide the fact that you're weak right now,
with your body in that state you're just going to get
yourself killed...! That's why―――"
<Page61>
I start to beg her not to push herself, but trail off
and look down at the ground.
It's just as Arcueid said――If she were to reveal how
weak she is, then the enemy would likely take the
opportunity to go in for the kill.
<Page62>
And above all, I realized something during those two
days.
When it comes to battle, Arcueid is strictly
no-nonsense.
She doesn't fight with an eye toward minimizing her own
injuries. The sole focus of her strategy is ensuring
that her opponent is defeated.
Arcueid prioritizes achieving her goal above all else.
She isn't about to let herself be talked out of it.
<Page63>
"――――"
Arcueid will not stop.
But if I let her go, I won't be able to talk to her
like this anymore.
This girl is so unafraid of her own death that it's
enough to drive me mad.
<Page64>
...So then why do I find myself picturing her smile?
If only I hadn't seen that face―――If only she acted
more like a vampire, then maybe I never would have
developed these feelings.
<Page65>
"What's wrong, Shiki?
Your body is shaking. Do you need to go to the toilet?"
"Arcueid, you... how can you―――"
How can she be so unreasonably calm about all this?
<Page66>
...I raise my head.
<Page67>
"Hm?"
Before my eyes stands the figure of a woman in white.
<Page68>
...I can't pretend she never existed.
I don't understand what this emotion is.
All I know is that the two days I spent with Arcueid
are something I'll never forget.
<Page69>
That's why―――The idea of parting ways with her here
and now, and then spending tomorrow night wondering
whether she's alive or dead, then the next night, and
the next... Forever regretting my decision and kicking
myself for being such a fool―――It would be
unbearable.
<Page70>
"...Give me a break. I've already got two messed up
eyes, and now it seems like there's something wrong
with my head..."
<Page71>
I've already had my fill of vampires.
I recall the fight against Vlov. The fear I felt back
then while skirting the precipice of death is so burned
into my mind that simply thinking back on it sends a
shiver down my spine.
<Page72>
This time will be no different. He's no ordinary
opponent. There's absolutely no need for me to get
involved.
Arcueid said she'd take care of it, so I should just
leave it to her.
<Page73>
And yet...
Even though that reasoning makes total sense to me...
...I still can't allow her to go alone―――
<Page74>
"Ah geez, there must be something seriously wrong with
me!"
I kick the ground.
Whatever logic I come up with, however I try to
persuade myself, it's useless. I'm furious at my own
stubbornness.
<Page75>
"H-Huh? What's wrong Shiki? Why are you angry all of a
sudden?"
"Of course I'm angry! Even after all I've been through,
I still can't stop myself from uttering such nonsense!"
I start to feel even dizzier after saying that.
If I saw my idiotic self in the mirror right now, I
would smash it without a second thought!
<Page76>
"C-Calm down. You're not acting normal."
"You're right, I'm not! If I were acting normally,
there's no way that I'd be able to say something like
this...!"
<Page77>
Cursing, I scratch my head in annoyance.
I don't want to admit it, but I've already made up my
mind.
Heck, I even went and said it out loud just then.
<Page78>
"Geez, I don't understand you at all!
Explain yourself! You've been going on about this and
that for a while, but what are you trying to say?!"
<Page79>
"Here's what I want to say:# until your body gets
better, I'm going to help you out!"
"―――Huh?"
<Page80>
Arcueid stares back at me, dumbfounded.
As for me, I finally―――or perhaps, I barely―――or
rather...
Enough of that. I told her exactly what I wanted to
say, and have calmed down at last.
<Page81>
"Shiki. Do you really mean that?"
"......"
, I groan.
I still can't even believe it myself.
<Page82>
"I think I might have missed what you said.
I'm sorry, but could you repeat that one more time?"
"........."
, I groan even louder.
<Page83>
But it's too late to regret it now.
The moment I uttered those words, I lost every right I
had to lie to myself.
<Page84>
"Come on. I want to hear that line just one more time."
<Page85>
Arcueid's coaxing voice is little more than a whisper.
Averting my gaze from her efflorescent smile, I do my
best to try and speak in an irritated voice.
<Page86>
"...Like I said. I'm the one responsible for the fact
that you're weak right now, and I can't just let these
monsters run rampant in the city.
I just can't let you take this on by yourself, not in
the state you're in. I want to help you... if you'll
let me."
<Page87>
"Shiki――――!"
Arcueid's eyes light up.
She grabs my hand and shakes it up and down with glee.
<Page88>
"...Well, I don't think I'll be of much help, but it
should be better than nothing."
"Yeah! If I have you around, there's nothing to be
afraid of!"
<Page89>
. . . Arcueid still hasn't let go of my
hand.
I'm afraid that sooner or later her brute strength will
tear my hand clean off, but even so, I have no desire
to stop her.
...How do I put this.
She really was smiling so exuberantly.
<Page90>
That was enough―――I felt, with some small amount of
pride, that my foolish decision wasn't a mistake after
all.
