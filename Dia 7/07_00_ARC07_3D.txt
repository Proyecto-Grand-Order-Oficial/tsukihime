<Page1>
"So, what did you want to talk about, Shiki?"
<Page2>
"Vampires. You said this before, right? That the serial
killings everyone's been in such a fuss over were the
work of a vampire."
Arcueid nods affirmatively.
<Page3>
"Then, did you know the news this morning reported that
another victim had been found?
Apparently, they were murdered sometime last night and
drained of their blood."
"―――――"
<Page4>
Arcueid narrows her eyes.
I feel a sudden tension; it's as though the solid
ground I thought I had been walking on was actually
naught but a thin layer of ice, and now one wrong move
could prove fatal.
<Page5>
"Hmm... and?"
"And―――you're..."
<Page6>
I swallow nervously.
Arcueid looks straight at me, pinning me down with her
gaze.
It was the sort of stare that made me feel as though
she'd swoop down on me the instant I moved a muscle.
<Page7>
"...But isn't it strange, Arcueid?
Vlov is dead. So then, why are these vampiric incidents
still happening? I'm sure this isn't the case, but...
could it be... that you―――"
If that blood is on your hands, then I―――
<Page8>
". You don't really believe that, do you?
That wasn't me, it was the work of a different
vampire."
Arcueid's immediate and somewhat exasperated response
quickly dispels the tension that had settled over us.
<Page9>
"――――――"
I hold back the inexplicable sense of joy that rises in
my throat.
It's too soon to be relieved.
While I'm glad to hear it was another vampire's doing,
there's still something that doesn't add up.
<Page10>
"If that's the case, then does it mean that these
vampires will keep coming one after the other? Did a
new vampire arrive right after Vlov?"
<Page11>
"Nothing of the sort. Those incidents were the work of
a single vampire from the very beginning.
No 'new vampire' has shown up to devour the city, nor
did Vlov have anything to do with those serial
killings."
...You're saying Vlov... was totally unrelated?
<Page12>
"What do you mean that he had nothing to do with it?"
"I mean exactly what I said... Geez, you're so
inattentive sometimes. It drives me mad."
<Page13>
"Are you listening? It's true that Vlov is a vampire,
but has he ever sucked anyone's blood?"
"Well, of course he did. That guy systematically burned
all those people to a crisp and then―――"
<Page14>
...Ah, I get it now.
Why didn't I spot such an obvious discrepancy?
All of the victims of the serial killer have been
discovered with no injuries to their bodies, other than
the fact that their blood was drained.
<Page15>
But that's not what Vlov would do.
That guy burns corpses to a crisp. It's true that he
sucks blood, but that's not the main way he kills
people.
<Page16>
If you think about it, the people in the hotel weren't
counted as victims in a murder case, but as casualties
of a conflagration.
Then―――that means Vlov has no connection at all to
the serial killings that have been happening in this
city...!
<Page17>
"Hold on. Then who is behind these vampire killings?
Who on earth would go out of their way to do that?"
<Page18>
"Like I said, those killings were the work of a vampire
other than Vlov.
I came to this city in order to kill the vampire behind
those murders."
<Page19>
"The reason behind Vlov coming here is... well, I'm no
longer entirely sure.
I was sure that he had come here chasing after me, but
that doesn't seem like enough of a reason... It seems
like he wasn't in league with the society of Dead
Apostles, either."
<Page20>
"Well, enough of that. Vlov is already dead, after all.
At any rate, Vlov and the vampire lurking in this city
are two different beings. He was genuinely nothing more
than an unrelated third party."
<Page21>
"I never said that Vlov was my target, did I?
Vlov may have considered me his target, but my
attention has always been focused on the 'serial
killer' vampire that's in this city.
...Shiki. I hate to ask, but have you really
misunderstood something so incredibly simple?"
<Page22>
"―――――"
I gasp in shock.
Unfortunately, she's right on the money.
<Page23>
Because she said that killing vampires was her
objective, I immediately jumped to the wrong conclusion
and assumed she came here to take down Vlov.
<Page24>
"...So, now what? Are you telling me that killing Vlov
that night was completely meaningless...?"
<Page25>
"It wasn't meaningless at all. You were the one who
fought in my place, right?# Though, it wouldn't have
been necessary if you hadn't killed me in the first
place."
<Page26>
"――――――"
The strength drains from my body, and I feel like I'm
about to fall to my knees.
...The battle that night was all for nothing.
...Even though we killed Vlov, it didn't solve
anything.
<Page27>
...There's still a vampire in this city―――for a
brief moment, I find myself blaming Arcueid.
...This isn't good.
My mind churns with a mixture of despondency and
self-loathing.
<Page28>
"...Sorry. I know it's annoying, but let me confirm one
last time.
So you're saying that Vlov is unrelated to the vampire
murders, and the one that's been causing havoc in this
city for the past month is a different vampire, right?"
<Page29>
"Yup, that's exactly right.
But that's a problem for me to deal with, so you don't
have to worry about it.# Leaving that aside..."
<Page30>
Arcueid looks up at me with a worryingly playful
expression.
<Page31>
"...What do you want?
Just so you know, I really don't have time to play
around."
I can't get a handle on my feelings.
If she says anything weird now, I feel like my legs
will simply give way.
<Page32>
"I just have a small question. It's about that time we
took down Vlov. Back then, why three minutes?"
"Three minutes... what do you mean?"
<Page33>
"Shiki, you said that you only had three minutes back
then. I could never figure out why it was only three."
"...Listen. Like I told you then, that place was like
being at the bottom of the ocean, right? That's why I
said that three minutes was the limit."
<Page34>
"Hm? You'd only last three minutes at the bottom of the
ocean?"
"――――――"
...Thank goodness.
If I still had any energy left, I'm sure my retort
would have been instantaneous.
<Page35>
"Yeah, that's right. Unlike you, I happen to be human,
so that's as much time as I can spend underwater."
<Page36>
"What the hell! E-Even I felt a bit chilly back then!
Besides, I'd get bored if I had to spend hours at the
bottom of the ocean as well!"
A 'bit chilly', you say.
It was so bad that I thought I was going to die.
"Hm? What are you looking down for?"
<Page37>
"...Nothing, I was just feeling a little dizzy. You
don't have to worry about it... No, I take that back.
To be honest, even spending three minutes underwater is
pushing it. Humans are frail, after all, so don't go
lumping us in with someone as sturdy as you. If you
want to have an endurance contest, then go do it with
another vampire."
<Page38>
At my wit's end, I shoo Arcueid away with my hand.
<Page39>
"...Well, there's no use in me saying it now.
At this point, I'm well aware of just how much of a
monster you are after all.
Fine, the whole misunderstanding about Vlov was stupid
on my part.
But besides that, Arcueid―――"
<Page40>
I manage to get my feelings under control, and raise my
head to resume the conversation, but...
What is this face that she's making...?
<Page41>
"Arcueid...?"
"You're such a bully, Shiki!
That's right, I'm not human, am I!"
<Page42>
Pouting, Arcueid turns away and begins to walk at a
brisk pace.
<Page43>
"Hey, wait a minute. Where do you think you're going?"
"This has nothing to do with a human like you! Don't
follow me!"
Arcueid must really be mad, as she continues to walk
away without looking back.
<Page44>
"........."
That woman... Where the hell does she think she's
going?
...Maybe I touched a nerve.
In retrospect, maybe I was a bit too cruel...
<Page45>
"...No, but I didn't say anything that bad..."
...I didn't... right?
Though, seeing how upset she is, I feel like I'm the
one at fault... Actually,   completely my fault.
I'm the worst.
<Page46>
"...Oh, fine! I was wrong! I shouldn't have said that!
So just stop. Stop right there!"
<Page47>
Flustered, I chase after her white back.
I'm definitely not doing this because I feel guilty
about making her upset.
There's just something important we still need to
discuss...!
