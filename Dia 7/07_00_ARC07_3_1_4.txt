This is a good opportunity. No, this is the best chance
I'm going to get.
To be honest, there's something I've been really
curious about...
<Page2>
"Those clothes you wore while fighting Vlov...# can I
see them?"
<Page3>
I thought as much.
It's only natural for her to make that face.
But I can't turn back now that I've let slip what I'm
thirsting for.
<Page4>
"You were too far away back then, so I couldn't really
make out what was going on.
It sorta seemed like you were wearing something
different to what you have on now."
<Page5>
I do my best to seem nonchalant. No matter what
happens, I must maintain the façade of having a purely
academic interest in this matter.
If Arcueid gets suspicious here, it would be an
incalculable loss.
<Page6>
"Ah, you mean the time I changed my appearance as a
countermeasure against Vlov?
Hmm, I'm tired so I don't really feel like it, but
since I still have the recipe for it..."
<Page7>
"There. Is this good enough?"
<Page8>
Good enough? That's not something you can casually say
after showing me something like this.
<Page9>
A streamlined and elegant form.
The smoothness of the silk gloves that envelop each of
her arms.
Her exposed shoulders are glamorous, yet purely
reserved.
<Page10>
...So this is how it feels to be at a loss for words.
A pure white beauty that can only be described as
lovely stands before me.
<Page11>
"――――――"
I let out an unintelligible sound in admiration.
I can hardly believe that the being before my eyes
right now is the same vampire that's been a thorn in my
side all day long.
She should come back to the mansion now that she has
this dress on. That would certainly be a sight to
behold.
<Page12>
"This dress is a reminder that I made a bad judgment
call, so I can't really say I'm that pleased with it.
If I had known that Vlov's Principle was 'Coldness', I
would have gone with something warmer."
<Page13>
...Now that she mentions it, it seems like the area
immediately surrounding Arcueid is quite cold.
I think I can even make out the sparkle of ice crystals
dancing in the air.
<Page14>
"I see. So the spec for this was to be heat resistant.
Does it also have a cooling function?"
<Page15>
"Exactly. Be careful not to touch it, okay? If you do,
you'll end up frozen solid.
This wasn't built to protect me directly, but to douse
any flames I might have encountered while grappling
with Vlov."
<Page16>
So in theory, she can defend herself while attacking at
the same time.
That really is just like her.
But even so, that appearance...
I don't want to admit it, but...
She really is a princess, huh...
<Page17>
"Geez. What's up with that perplexed look on your face?
Wait, Shiki―――don't tell me you're laughing at my
mistakes?"
<Page18>
"As if. If this is a mistake, then so is 90% of
everything in this world. Wearing this regularly...
wouldn't work out after all, you'd be way too
conspicuous.
Besides, there's no way I can let anyone else get a
glimpse. Something like this is for my eyes only."
<Page19>
"R-Really now? So you're saying, that you like it?"
I suddenly regain my composure.
I can't believe I let her get that much out of me with
such a simple attack.
<Page20>
"W-Well in a way I guess. When we fight together, I'll
be relying on you for a bunch of things, after all."
I'll try to save myself somehow.
Seemingly delighted at my use of the phrase 'rely on
you', Arcueid responds―――
<Page21>
"Of course! I'm basically good at everything after all!
You don't really have any talents apart from killing,
so I'll do my utmost to support you!"
<Page22>
"――――――"
...I think I just inadvertently sparked a strange sense
of confidence inside her.
<Page23>
This woman, she definitely said that while picturing
striking me like a tennis ball...
Maybe I shouldn't have come up with such a harebrained
scheme during our fight with Vlov...
<Page24>
"By the way, do those clothes have a name or anything?"
"A name? I don't usually give names to everything like
that...
I guess the dress code is, hmm... something like 'Clad
in Glaciers'?
That's the image I had in mind while creating this."
<Page25>
"Hmm. Then if you had seen through Vlov's power―――"
"Then I would have used an image of Kilauea. That's
still an active volcano, even today."
I would love nothing more than to see her in a cute 'A
Hawaiian Me' dress code like that.
<Page26>
"Hey, can I change back now?
I don't like to waste energy after all."
...I'm reluctant to see it go, but I can't think of any
more reasons to stop her.
I do my best to keep my composure as I tell her to go
ahead.
Separately to that, I've been wondering―――
<Page27>
"Hey, why did you choose a dress as a combat uniform
against Vlov?
It's not like we were off to go mingle with high
society."
<Page28>
"Hmm? But isn't that what we did?"
"―――#I see."
It seems that in the world of vampires, that is what
they would consider a black-tie event.
