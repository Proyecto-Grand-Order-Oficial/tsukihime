<Page1>
"I'm home."
Doing my best to sound carefree, I enter the lobby.
<Page2>
...?
I can hear voices coming from the living room... I
wonder who it could be.
It's just before dinner. I wouldn't have expected to
hear anyone chatting in there at this hour.
Kohaku-san should be in the kitchen, and I don't think
Hisui's the type to strike up a conversation with
Akiha.
<Page3>
"...I wonder if Akiha is drinking tea with Kohaku-san
or something."
The other possibility is that there's a guest over.
I start to head over to see what's going on, but―――
<Page4>
Right as I do so, Hisui comes out from the living room.
She must have come to greet me after hearing my voice,
but... is it just me, or is her expression gloomier
than usual?
<Page5>
"I'm back, Hisui. Sorry for being late."
"........."
Hisui stares at me vacantly.
She doesn't even respond with her usual 'welcome back'.
<Page6>
"Ummm... did something happen?
I might be imagining it, but you look a little
upset..."
<Page7>
"―――There is a visitor for you.
She has been waiting in the living room for quite some
time, so please make your way there at once."
"A visitor for me?"
Hisui nods affirmatively.
<Page8>
"...That's odd. I can't think of anyone that would drop
by to see me. Arihiko's the only person that knows
where I've moved, and it's not like I met anyone new
recently―――"
―――No, hang on.
I have an incredibly bad feeling about this.
<Page9>
"Hisui. This visitor... what're they like?"
"She is a beautiful lady with blonde hair."
<Page10>
"Wha―――"
Hisui's description was straight to the point.
Instinctively, my body breaks into a run and I race for
the devil's living room as fast as my legs will carry
me.
<Page11>
"What the hell is going on here―――?!"
I throw the door wide and burst into the room.
<Page12>
Alas, it's already too late.
I'm greeted by the latest plot twist in my character
development, another situation beyond my control that
promises to upend my world all over again.
<Page13>
"Look who it is. Welcome back, Nii-san.
I see you are late again this evening, as expected."
<Page14>
"Ah, you're finally here, you rascal. Not only do you
make your little sister wait, but me as well. You
really are quite the tyrant."
<Page15>
Both of them are looking at me, but their expressions
are like night and day.
...This feeling. I know this feeling.
It's the sort of thing that shows up a lot in films.
The suffocating, heart-rending desperation of a soldier
with a gun to the back of their head being told to beg
for their life.
<Page16>
"........."
I don't think I'm going to be able to talk my way out
of this one.
<Page17>
Of all the things that could have happened... Arcueid
and Akiha have come face-to-face.
Arcueid is standing there placidly while Akiha sits on
the sofa looking similarly composed.
But under the surface... While Arcueid's calm demeanor
is just a natural consequence of her being an airhead,
Akiha's is simply a veneer over her obvious hostility
toward Arcueid.
<Page18>
Akiha glances toward me.
<Page19>
"What's the matter, Nii-san? Don't just stand in the
doorway like that. Why don't you come over here and
take a seat?"
<Page20>
Absolutely not. I have the feeling that I'd end up with
a knife stuck in me the second I get within range of
the sofa. There's no way I'm going near it.
<Page21>
"I-I'm good here, thanks.
More importantly, Akiha, this person here is,
well――――"
<Page22>
...How do I explain this to her?
I can't just pass her off as a classmate, and I get the
feeling that saying I met her on the street would only
make things worse.
<Page23>
"Well? Go on."
Akiha pierces me with her unforgiving gaze.
<Page24>
Fine. We're probably past the point where anything I
say can make a difference, but if I want to make sure
nobody gets hurt... and, of course, that my own peace
isn't threatened... I've no choice but to come up with
some kind of explanation.
<Page25>
I've got to come up with an explanation, but before I
get to that――― Under what pretense did this vampire,
happily standing there with a grin on her face as
though this is all no concern of hers, manage to make
her way into the mansion in the first place?
I find it pretty hard to believe that Akiha would
invite a stranger into the living room.
<Page26>
"...Before that, can I ask something?
This person, what did she say she came for?"
"Hmm?"
Arcueid tilts her head, perplexed.
<Page27>
"...Is she not a friend of yours?
That's how she introduced herself."
", yeah, that's right, a friend, a friend..."
<Page28>
"I see. In that case, I would be overjoyed if you could
formally introduce me to her.
If she's one of Nii-san's friends, then I can hardly
turn her away at the door, can I?"
"Well, about that, Akiha-san."
<Page29>
My words devolve into a mumble.
". A friend, you say? ."
Perhaps having grown tired of being ignored, Arcueid
forces her way into the sibling squabble Akiha and I
are having.
<Page30>
"To think that's all I am to you, even after you did
such terrible things. My body still hurts, you know."
"Wha――――――"
<Page31>
I feel faint.
Ah, so this is what people mean by vertigo.
This feeling of drunkenness, of being forcibly torn
adrift from reality... I can't bear it.
<Page32>
"...What do you mean by that? Are you implying that my
brother has caused you harm physically, or perhaps
mentally?
I don't mean to be rude, but are you aware of how
unbelievable that claim of yours is?"
<Page33>
"Yeah, totally. But relax, it doesn't bother me
anymore. He paid me back with his body, after all.
Anyway, don't mind me. I only came here to grab Shiki.
We'll be off before you know it. Isn't that right,
Shiki?"
<Page34>
―――This is bad.
If I let this woman keep talking, it'll be the end of
me.
<Page35>
"Well, !"
Laughing in frantic desperation, I run over to Arcueid,
#and forcefully grab her by the arm.
<Page36>
"Geez, Shiki, what's gotten into you?"
I can't afford to sit here and listen to her
complaints.
I rush out of the living room, dragging Arcueid along
after me and leaving a dumbfounded Akiha in my wake.
<Page37>
Hisui is waiting in the lobby.
I wonder what's going through her mind as she watches
me rush by with Arcueid in tow. Thinking about it makes
me feel like a pit is opening up in my stomach, so I'll
just put it out of my mind for the time being.
<Page38>
"Are you heading out, Shiki-sama?"
"Against my better judgment. I know I'm asking for a
lot and I'm incredibly sorry, but please leave the
front door unlocked for me."
"As you wish. Please take good care of yourself."
<Page39>
As Hisui bows courteously, I sprint past her and out of
the mansion, making my escape.
