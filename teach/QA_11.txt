The protagonist is not the only one who faces a dead end.
#Even our heroine meets a merciless fate.
<Page2>
A fair and fitting end.
#So, with that being said―――
<Page3>
Let's hear some thoughts from our lovely
heroine,# who tragically met a brutal end
for a second time!
<Page4>
The stand's all yours, Arcueid-san!
#And also, congratulations to the next heroine in line!
<Page5>
...You are quite the crude instructor.
#And yet you still call yourself a holder of the ■■■■?
<Page6>
...Huh?
#Umm, and who might you be...?
<Page7>
Where did that cat-like creature run off to?
#I thought it was Arcueid's representative?
<Page8>
...How utterly wrong.# Not only are you
dull, but your intelligence leaves much
to be desired.
<Page9>
That creature you speak of is not her
alter ego,# nor is it her familiar.
<Page10>
It is simply an anomaly; a jargon that has been
misinterpreted# as an urban legend and started to walk
on its own.
<Page11>
If you are seeking thoughts regarding her
demise,# there exists someone more qualified
than that creature.
<Page12>
Needless to say, I'm talking about myself.
#After all, I'm no stranger to this matter.
<Page13>
...I-It can't be.
<Page14>
Arcueid's representative in this corner isn't the cat-like
#creature that had been here until now, but rather...
<Page15>
Yes. This corner's Arcueid Brunestud# is me.
<Page16>
It costs a severe amount of money to have
#me appear as an image of the future as
you do.
<Page17>
So, in order to save on costs, I have
appeared# as an image of my past.
<Page18>
...Hmm, yeah.
<Page19>
Since I'm an economical version of
Arcueid,# you can call me Eco-Arc.
<Page20>
Eco-Arc...!
<Page21>
Then that means that vaguely feline creature
#won't appear anymore, right? Woohoo!
<Page22>
Don't get carried away.
#To put it bluntly, I will only appear
on rare occasions.
<Page23>
Next time, and the time after, and so on
for all eternity,# your partner will be that
creature.
<Page24>
Oh, is that so...# Thanks for informing me of the hellish
future I have in store...
<Page25>
But then, why is it that# you're the one here
with me this time, Eco-Arc?
<Page26>
I assume you must be here to lodge a
complaint# about Tohno-kun's brutish behavior?
<Page27>
...Perhaps so.# Even I found myself having to look away near
the end.
<Page28>
...Not only did he succumb to his desires,
#but he couldn't even deal with his broken
self afterward.
<Page29>
With the way things turned out, even I cannot suppress my
disdain.# I am furious... No, worse. I pity you.
<Page30>
Now then, Ciel-sensei.
#I have a favor to ask.
<Page31>
Y-Yes!?
#How may I be of service, ma'am?
<Page32>
If you ever have to fight against that
thing,# please give her a merciless beating.
<Page33>
After all, one cannot become a fine lady
#until they've had at least one traumatic
experience.
<Page34>
I wouldn't have held back against Arcueid
#even if you hadn't asked me to―――
<Page35>
Huh? Don't tell me that the person you're
#actually furious at is―――
<Page36>
I have nothing else to say on the matter.
#I leave him to you from here on out.
<Page37>
Unreliable as you may be as an instructor,
#I can at least trust you as much as a shelf.
<Page38>
Ehh... what was that about?
<Page39>
I'm late, I'm late...!
Neco here, arriving at the speed of light!
<Page40>
That's right, the speed of light allowed me to overtake
#my oversleeping self, canceling out the fact that
I was late.
<Page41>
Heya, mornin' Ciel-kun!
#Looking sub-heroine-like today too,
excellent, excellent!
<Page42>
By the way, did I happen to come by
here earlier?
<Page43>
I feeeel like that was the case nya~.
#A super pretty version of me, to be precise.
<Page44>
I don't remember anyone who fits that
description.
More impor-tant-ly...
<Page45>
How would you like to be punished for being late?
#Burning at the stake, drawn and quartered, wooden horse,
iron maiden...
<Page46>
We have a variety of methods available,
#so the choice is all yours.
<Page47>
Ah. Perhaps you would like to be cut into
pieces# and <bleed| b l a d e  > to death just like the
Arcueid in the main story?
<Page48>
Please stop using words that I've never heard before.
#Besides, these dead ends are for four-eyes―――
<Page49>
Eei.
<Page50>
Uwahh, this Indian is serious!
#Executing me just for being late, have you finally
shown your true colors!?
<Page51>
Oh no, this was not my original intention,# but there
was someone who asked for a favor ♥
<Page52>
The story seemed to be nearing the climax,
#so I thought this might be a good opportunity
to change out the leading role.
<Page53>
Stoop, even for your modification fetish, this is a
step too far~~!!# What are you going to do if it becomes
a habit?
