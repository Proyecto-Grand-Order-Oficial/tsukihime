This is the Q&A corner where we provide guidance to
Tohno-kun,# who has reached a rather unexpected
dead end.
<Page2>
It's time for 'Teach Me, Ciel-Sensei!'.
#Good evening, Instructor Ciel here.
<Page3>
God Cat.
<Page4>
Now then. Do you have any idea what caused
him# to end up dead this time, God?
<Page5>
Don't ask me, I'm just a God.
#It's not like there were any
choices right before it.
<Page6>
Indeed, this is a rather unusual case.
#This outcome occurred due to a much earlier choice.
<Page7>
Snooping around late at night is bad enough,
#lying to a member of your household about it is
downright reprehensible.
<Page8>
If you know which choice I'm referring to, then try
#going back and being more sincere.
<Page9>
Lying is bad, honesty is king nya.
#Yup, yup. That's exactly right.
<Page10>
I mean, take the vampire heroine that looks
just like me,# isn't she so beautifully
pure of heart?
<Page11>
After all, a true heroine should never
lie# or have anything to hide.
<Page12>
Hey, isn't that right, Ciel-sensei?
<Page13>
Speaking of which, is there something that
#you'd like to share with us nya~?
<Page14>
―――Tch!
<Page15>
Nya nya nya, it's useless～☆
#You'll never land a hit on my true heroine heart nya～☆
<Page16>
Oof oof wah st- sto- nyagh-
<Page17>
Haah... well, aren't you nimble...
#I see... I guess we were... evenly matched...
<Page18>
Well then, that's all for now!# I look
forward to seeing you again at the next
dead end!
<Page19>
Ack... I guess your weapons and weight aren't the only
things you've been keeping a secret...
