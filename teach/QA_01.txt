Good evening.#
Were you surprised by the sudden bad end?
<Page2>
This is the rescue corner to guide the lost
#Tohno-kun to the right ending.
<Page3>
Welcome to 'Teach Me, Ciel-Sensei!'.
#Instructor Ciel here.
(Presumed to be 18 years old)
<Page4>
Seriously?
#How come you're an instructor when it says
'sensei' in the title?
<Page5>
Well, let's not worry about these minor details.
#You'll get the gist when you see me in action.
<Page6>
Good afternoon, Sommelier Queen of the bad end world
Neco-Arc here.
#I'm banned from the main story for being way too sexy.
<Page7>
You, are you perhaps new to this kind of adult corner?
#Well, this is the first lesson after all, so let's
settle down, shall we?
<Page8>
It's fine for you to just ignore this creature next to me.
#You only need to pay attention to what I have to say for
these lessons.
<Page9>
Now, about the cause of death this time...
<Page10>
You're already burning up, four-eyes.
#Isn't being a human torch on the road a bit too hardcore?
<Page11>
How did it even turn out like this, Ciel?
#Were there landmines in the streets of this
city?
<Page12>
To answer that question, it was because
#you went out alone even though you were
spotted.
<Page13>
'There's no way I'm staying in a room with this brain-dead
#vampire, so I'm going back home!'
<Page14>
I understand how painful it is for you
#but you must be patient, little one.
<Page15>
Although you were dragged into this mess,
#you can't deny that you are involved now.
<Page16>
The enemy in question...
until you deal with this vampire,
#you absolutely must not go back home!
<Page17>
Even when you go outside,
#you still have one last chance, right?
<Page18>
At that time,
#all you have to do is go back to the hotel.
<Page19>
But like... if you come back with your tail between your
legs, maybe you'll lose the heroine's affection.
#That's gotta be embarrassing.
<Page20>
Let's lose all her affection, then.
#In fact, please be mean to her at every
opportunity.
<Page21>
After all, no matter what Tohno-kun says,
#it won't change this vampire's affection for him!
<Page22>
Ehh, I don't think that's true nya~.
#'Cause I get angry too~.
<Page23>
But y'knoow, I kinda get a kick out
#of him getting really mad at me, actually.
<Page24>
See? There you go again.
#Are you genuinely unaware that
you have love on the brain?
<Page25>
Why can't you follow the example of your fellow heroine,#
who works hard and keeps her cool to the end?
<Page26>
Huh?# (That's rich, coming from you.)
<Page27>
Huh?# (What kind of reaction is that?)
<Page28>
Huh?# (Wait, you're actually serious?)
