Welcome To My Territory.# Come on in, you
miserable bad boy.
<Page2>
If you make a choice while na√Øvely thinking,
#'Well, they're both the same', you end up
like this.
<Page3>
Ambivalent four-eyes STRIKE! And thus you enter this
rescue corner.# 'Teach Me, Ciel-Sensei!' is about to begin~.
<Page4>
Good afternoon to those who have returned.
#And for newcomers, nice to meet you too.
<Page5>
Most players will be seeing this lesson for
the first time,# so I'll start by introducing
myself.
<Page6>
I am Ciel, the instructor of this Q&A corner.
#And here with me is my <assistant|s a n d b a g    > Neco-Arc.
<Page7>
In each lesson, I will briefly explain the cause of the
dead end,# so I hope you will stay until the end.
<Page8>
Usually, the last choice you made was a bad one,# so all
you have to do is go back and pick the other.
<Page9>
Sometimes there are dead ends that happen because
#of a choice made a long time ago, so you can't be too
careful.
<Page10>
We'll explain those cases when the time comes.# This time,
we have the common 'instant death dead end'.
<Page11>
When faced with an unusual situation, it's a good idea to
cautiously observe...# but this time it was not the right
call.
<Page12>
After all, there was no way to escape.
<Page13>
Unless you can fly,# I would not recommend taking up
position on the roof of the hotel.
<Page14>
He could have escaped if he had been a cat.
#Cats can fly through the air, you know.
<Page15>
Hmm? When you say 'fly', what do you mean?
#Do you mean they jump from roof to roof?
<Page16>
But even for a cat,# jumping from
the top floor of a hotel is a
bit...
<Page17>
She pulled out a rocket and
flew...!
<Page18>
That cat is no help at all!
