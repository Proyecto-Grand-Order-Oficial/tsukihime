Why do birds sing?
#Why do shrimp leap?
<Page2>
Why did the protagonist break into a locked room?
<Page3>
The intellectual program that tackles the countless
mysteries of human history head-on,
#'Teach Me, Ciel-Sensei!'―――
<Page4>
Starts right now!
<Page5>
Hello there. Are you feeling well-rested after the
#lack of dead ends in days 6-8?
<Page6>
The story is really starting to heat up now.
#From here on out, the number of dead ends will
only increase.
<Page7>
I hope that the wise and prudent Tohno-kun will
#choose his path with great care going forward.
<Page8>
Now, as for the cause of this dead end...
#You were stabbed in the back, weren't you?
<Page9>
Seems like four-eyes didn't get the memo about being
careful nya.# Or maybe that bandaged guy is more capable
than he looks?
<Page10>
As strange and captivating as that room may be...
#Tohno-kun is squarely at fault for being so careless.
<Page11>
Besides,# this kind of undercover work is
best done in pairs.
<Page12>
One person to watch the door to spot anyone coming,
#while the other examines the documents...
<Page13>
It would be best to refrain from investigating this study
#until you are able to team up with someone you can rely on.
<Page14>
Just like an S-P-Y!
Mmm, but do we know anyone who fits the bill?
<Page15>
Ciel is a martial artist, so I don't think
#she's cut out for that kind of thing.
<Page16>
As a lone operator, there's nothing I can't do,
#but supporting Tohno-kun while infiltrating...
<Page17>
Frankly, it would not suit me at all.
#It would be nice if you could find that ally someday.
<Page18>
Hehehe... you just revealed a new flag...
#Who could it be? One of the maids? Sacchin?
<Page19>
Well, I guess we'll see.
<Page20>
Either way, whatever is going on here has
#no connection to our vampire case.
<Page21>
Now then. The cause of death is clear this time,
#so you can simply go back and pick the other choice.
<Page22>
A wise man steers clear of danger.
#Maybe give Tohno Makihisa's study a miss, and
head somewhere a little safer!
<Page23>
The inside of that mansion is lousy with
#death traps, just what the heck is going
on in there?
