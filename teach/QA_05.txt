Hmm, where did I put it nya?
#What was I looking for nya?
<Page2>
I can't even remember where I got it from nya.
#Although I bought three of the same one by accident nya.
<Page3>
Oh well, time to throw away everything I don't need!
#Nyahaha, in the trash you go!
<Page4>
And while I'm at it, later, doll-protagonist!
#E - N - DO - R - PH - IN, let's go!
<Page5>
Hold on a second!
#You can't throw that away!
<Page6>
Huh? Ah, crap.
<Page7>
Ah......
<Page8>
Ah......
<Page9>
W-Well, it just seems to be a doll at least...
#It shouldn't be a problem... I think...
<Page10>
True that nya.
#Welp, guess it was destiny.
<Page11>
Could this... be a sign that the protagonist will
#be launched into the air in a spectacular fashion?
<Page12>
Hahaha. Surely not.# There's no way that even Tohno-kun
would come up with such a reckless―――
<Page13>
Such a reckless―――
<Page14>
...Oh, he actually did.# That was rather
bold, or should I say suicidal?
<Page15>
If he wants to become a human cannonball, just leave
him to it.# Mmm, I do like a guy with a lot of spirit
though nya.
<Page16>
Maybe the reason it failed was due to
#the wrong X and Y coordinates nya?
<Page17>
All three choices here are equally unreasonable,
#so it's not as if there's much to differentiate them
in terms of difficulty...
<Page18>
So please go back to the last choice
#and try a different strategy this time.
<Page19>
The battle against Vlov will soon reach its climax.
#Victory is always within reach... Tohno-kun!
