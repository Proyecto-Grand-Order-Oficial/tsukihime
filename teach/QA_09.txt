Hmm? It seems that day 10 started as usual,
#we went to school just like any other day,
and then the game just ended.
<Page2>
What the heck is going on Ciel?
#An error? Did they not finish
the rest of the game nya?
<Page3>
I can't see how any of the choices you made
might have led you here nya...
#Huh? You broke a promise with your sister?
<Page4>
But the promise with that blonde beauty is more important,
right?# I'm pretty sure this was the correct route
too, so how come...?
<Page5>
What are you talking about?
<Page6>
You still decided to go out despite the fact that
Akiha-san was so worried about you.# Quite simply,
you failed as an older brother.
<Page7>
You may have felt off-color on previous
occasions and carried on,# but today you are
experiencing a more peculiar illness.
<Page8>
This sort of affliction takes at least half a day's
rest to recover from,# so make sure you get
some shut-eye, okay?
<Page9>
Of course, it is completely okay to miss
#the meeting with Arcueid.
<Page10>
Since it was a verbal promise, it is neither
#legally enforceable nor subject to penalties â™¥
<Page11>
But this ain't an issue of legality nya~.
#It's a matter of what's right in our
hearts nya~.
<Page12>
But if this ends up with them missing each other,
#you know what they say, absence makes the heart grow
fonder... ehehe...
<Page13>
It's here... I feel it...# surely there's gotta be a
date event right around the corner...!
<Page14>
Oh yeah. Ciel doesn't have a date event, right?
#Sorry... for my privilege, that is.
<Page15>
Oh no, you've got it all wrong. In fact, we're together all
the time at school.# We're not only together at night so you
needn't worry.
<Page16>
If you look at the ratio of time talking
with Tohno-kun,# you'll see that I come out
ahead 6:4.
<Page17>
Huuh?
#Isn't most of that just you info dumping church stuff?
<Page18>
It's not as long as the lecture on the vampire hierarchy.
<Page19>
In our case, it was simply a pure, platonic
conversation# between a lost junior
and his reliable senior.
<Page20>
Hey, I went to school too.
<Page21>
Well, I suppose you are one to trespass,
aren't you?
<Page22>
Well, I also had cool clothes, like the combat
dress.
<Page23>
Ah, the one you wore that time Vlov instantly
defeated you? (laughs).# At least the
transformation sequence was nice?
<Page24>
You're dead, punk!
<Page25>
Come at me!
