I wonder if you've gotten used to the sudden deaths by
now?
<Page2>
This is the rescue corner for Tohno-kun,
#who has died despite his best efforts.
<Page3>
'Teach Me, Ciel-Sensei!'
#Let's get stuck right into it
this time too!
<Page4>
That being said, this is your standard three-choice
death trap, right?# We just have to go back and pick
another option, no?
<Page5>
Shouldn't the rescue corner be about
#saving people before they get killed?
<Page6>
I only just realized this, but―――
<Page7>
Isn't this corner just us giving color
#commentary on each of four-eyes'
untimely deaths?
<Page8>
Huh? Well, yes, but what of it?
<Page9>
He won't remember if it doesn't hurt,
will he?
<Page10>
Mmmm~~, you went right past Spartan straight to Sadist.
<Page11>
Now then, the cause of death this time is due to
#Tohno-kun entering the school, at night, alone.
<Page12>
There was no Senpai to rely on, and there was no way
#Arcueid would go somewhere isolated in her
current state.
<Page13>
So, go back to the previous choice# and choose a place
that reeks of blood!
<Page14>
'In her current state'?
#Did I hear that correctly?
<Page15>
Ciel, do you know why that perfect# heroine decided
to run away (※be cute)?
<Page16>
Is it not because she was so overflowing with energy
#that she just had to rush home?
<Page17>
Who knows?
#I can't really say.
<Page18>
If I had to guess, maybe it's because she finally# realized
that she really is a vampire?
Took her long enough.
<Page19>
I mean, she barely seemed to be keeping herself
#in check ever since that rampage in the garage
full of the Dead.
<Page20>
Seriously? She was suffering from a fever (※cuteness)
even back then?# Wow, Ciel really has no chance at
winning, huh?
<Page21>
Are you okay?
Wanna go back home (India)?
<Page22>
Who says that I'm from India?!
<Page23>
More importantly, just because it's your
route# doesn't mean you should get too
carried away.
<Page24>
It's not just the adorable Tohno-kun,
#for whom sudden a death is very fitting,
that can die, you know.
<Page25>
Wait, did you say 'fitting'?
<Page26>
As the story progresses, there is a possibility that
#anyone can die. Arcueid is no exception.
<Page27>
Ehh~~?
#Surely there's no way I could lose now.
<Page28>
The good ending's pretty much in the bag, right?
#Even a newborn calico kitty could see that.
<Page29>
I see.
#So what would happen if you were wrong?
<Page30>
Nyha nyha nyha. How silly... That's not gonna happen.
#I'll stake the heroine role for the next route on it!
<Page31>
Hold on a sec.
#What was that really ominous sound effect
about?
<Page32>
Now that I've got your word,
let's wrap up the lesson!
<Page33>
That's all for this corner,
#'Goodbye, Neco-Arc-Sensei!' ~☆
<Page34>
Oi, stop with that scary smile!
You don't deserve to be a heroine!
