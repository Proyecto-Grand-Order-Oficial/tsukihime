OS. OS. OS.# Phew.
<Page2>
I've been pressing the O and S keys for 20 hours.# With
all this typing, I could have developed an app by now.
<Page3>
Phew... nothing like some coffee after work.
#This atmosphere makes me feel like even I
finished a hard day's work.
<Page4>
Now then, as for this morning's
<Glasses Gazette|d e a d   e n d   >...# Ahh, a direct hit from the
enemy I see.
<Page5>
Four-eyes, could this be...# an attempt to
reincarnate into another world?
<Page6>
(How on earth is she pressing the keys with those hands?)
#I see...
<Page7>
Since what you did here was like pulling a dump truck onto
yourself,# one could argue this incident arose from
your own carelessness.
<Page8>
However, it could also be due to the bad influence from
that vampire.
<Page9>
I mean, if you have a unit of heavy machinery like an
excavator right next to you,# it's only human nature
to want to use it for a tricky job.
<Page10>
How is that human nature?# And don't call me a unit.
It's heroine. Heroine.
<Page11>
They're basically the same.
#Just look at the end result.
<Page12>
Geez. It's not like you at all to act so
#freely without considering the consequences.
<Page13>

Were you feeling dizzy from all the damage you took?
<Page14>
Nyah. Wasn't I just overly happy# from being
relied on so much?
<Page15>
―――I see.# I hope you get kicked to death
by a horse.
<Page16>
It seems that half of the blame goes to Tohno-kun# and
the other half goes to Arcueid.
<Page17>
This is no time for playing
around.# The climax is right in
front of you.
<Page18>
This time, try to choose the option that
will# get you as far away from Arcueid
as possible!
<Page19>
Ehh~~.# If it was you in that situation, bet you would
have done the same nya~.
<Page20>
Hehe. No way, absolutely not.# I don't have
that kind of muscle strength after all.
