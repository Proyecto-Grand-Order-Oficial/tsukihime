Huh... what's up with this ending?
#Was Tsukihime always a horror
game?
<Page2>
What the heck did you do this time,
four-eyes?
<Page3>
Are you telling me that you did something to deserve
having your# ass handed to you by a bunch of zombies?
<Page4>
Oh, so you did.# You tried to go at it alone
against all those zombies.
<Page5>
But if you cut a zombie, it will bite you back.# So all in
all, I guess you got your just desserts nya.
<Page6>
Remember folks, don't go into a building# with a sign that
says 'Do not enter', okay?
<Page7>
(That cat actually said something sensible...)
<Page8>
Ahem. It was very noble of you to be so eager
to# fight to protect the people of the city.
<Page9>
However, it seems that luck was not on your side.
#This is not a problem that Tohno-kun can handle alone.
<Page10>
How unfortunate... Perhaps if things turn out a little
differently,# you could try going back to the department
store again with that same courage.
<Page11>
Huuh. So you're telling him to go again after witnessing
that horror scene.# Yup, you're definitely a sadist.
<Page12>
But why did this turn out so bad?
#Maybe challenging them to a rap battle was the play here?
<Page13>
The two men who were guarding the department store
#were irritated because there had been some trouble the day
before.
<Page14>
The hardworking heroine had surveyed the department store
that day,# so they were on guard as a result.
<Page15>
So, if for whatever reason,# that heroine was not
able to work on that day...
<Page16>
Then the two guards at the department store# would not
have had such murderous intent.
<Page17>
I don't want to say this too loud, but once you clear
#one of the routes, spend some time after school in the
tea room.
<Page18>
This department store vampire event
#is a major turning point for a heroine
change.
<Page19>
So folks, make sure you keep this info in mind!
