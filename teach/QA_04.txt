Oh dear, a dead end!
<Page2>
Hey, Tohno-kun!# Stop right there, you are
under arrest for speeding!
<Page3>
Why do you look so happy, Ciel?
#There's a BBQ'd protagonist right here, y'know?
<Page4>
Pardon me. The big battle had finally begun,
#so I got a bit carried away...
<Page5>
This Q&A corner is brought to you by your host:
#me, Ciel, together with this outsider, Neco...
<Page6>
Welcome to 'Teach Me, Ciel-Sensei!'
<Page7>
Depending on how you've played,
#this may have been your first dead end.
<Page8>
Well, then, it simply must have been the
natural choice to make,# or at least, this
time it was.
<Page9>
But let's stay calm and assess the situation carefully.
#After all, humans cannot survive being on fire!
<Page10>
Well, from a feline point of view,
#I can appreciate this kind of dead end nya.
<Page11>
Think about it, there's a woman of unrivaled beauty
fighting in front of you.# Who in their right mind could keep
their cool? There's a phrase for this.
<Page12>
'Picking chestnuts out of the fire for
someone else's picnic.
#Welcome, welcome, well-done.'
<Page13>
What do you think?
#Does it irresistibly whet your appetite, mademoiselle?
<Page14>
No, I have no idea what you're saying...
#Although, I personally like my meat
well-done...
<Page15>
Oh really? That was unexpected.
#You don't like your steak a little bloody even though
you're from France?
<Page16>
I like tender meat the most when it comes to beef curry,
#but rare steak is a bit... much.
<Page17>
The people who like rare, or something like 
raw sashimi,# would be someone like Akiha-san,
I guess.
<Page18>
I mean, Japanese people are known for preparing sashimi
#from raw fish, right? It's hard to believe.
<Page19>
You fool. Fish is better the fresher it is.
<Page20>
If you don't take my word for it,
#I'll buy you a round of S-rank sushi next
time.
<Page21>

You do like <'karei'|r i g h t e y e   f l o u n d e r>, right, otaku?
<Page22>
...Well, it's not like I eat it every#day either...
<Page23>

Sometimes seafood is the way to go...
<Page24>
Right. It seems that we have completely different tastes.
#Oh well. Come on, wrap it up. We'll have dinner after
this.
<Page25>
R-Right, of course.# We're still
in the middle of the lesson.
<Page26>
Well, suffice to say, a fight between vampires
#is extremely dangerous, so please stay calm and watch
the fight from a safe distance.
<Page27>
Don't worry. I'm sure Tohno-kun will have his chance to
shine.# So until then, make sure that you preserve your
stamina!
<Page28>
―――Right, that's a job well done!
#We're going straight to Messiaen!
<Page29>

...This time, it's seafood curry!
<Page30>
