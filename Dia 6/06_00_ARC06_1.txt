The gentle rays of the sun dispel my sleepiness.
Though my eyes remain closed, I can feel the serenity
of my surroundings seep into every pore.
The air is moderately cool, yet gentle.
Somehow, it feels like the sky today is clearer than
it's ever been.
<Page2>
In that case, I should get up and go to school.
After all, I've been so beset by misfortune these past
two days I almost forgot I was still a student―――
<Page3>
"......"
...I open my eyes.
I'm lying on the bed, and my glasses are on the
nightstand.
<Page4>
Acting on autopilot, I put them on and let my gaze
wander.
The sunlight streaming through the window is so vibrant
that I can almost hear it calling me outside.
<Page5>
I take a deep breath# and savor the fresh air.
...Oh, right, it's Sunday――there's no school.
<Page6>
The hands of the clock make a ticking sound.
I can hear little birds chirping outside.
―――Ah, I'm back.
It's a morning just like any other, but now it feels
exceptionally pure.
<Page7>
"―――Thank goodness."
I don't feel this way because I'm alive, or because I
was able to do something about that vampire.
I'm thankful because I was able to go back to my normal
life after going through that extraordinary event.
Thankful that I can happily enjoy a morning like this.
There is no greater reward for an insignificant person
such as myself―――
<Page8>
"Good morning, Shiki-sama.#"
"!"
<Page9>
I reflexively snap bolt upright.
I look over, and see Hisui standing at attention in
front of the door.
<Page10>
"H-Hisui―――"
<Page11>
"...My sincerest apologies.
It seemed you were rather unaware of my presence, so I
decided to call out to you, but..."
"Ah―――no, well, I'm sorry as well."
<Page12>
She startled me.
I've only just woken up, and already my heart is
pounding...
<Page13>
"...Huh? But it's not even seven o'clock."
"Yes. It is a little earlier than you'd normally wake
up, Shiki-sama."
"I guess so. What brings you all the way here then,
Hisui?"
<Page14>
"I came to wake you up.
Akiha-sama wishes for you to explain to her what you
have been up to these past two days, and has instructed
me to bring you before her by any means necessary."
<Page15>
"――――――"
'Akiha', 'the past two days', 'explain'.
These cryptic words fly around inside my brain.
<Page16>
Resisting the temptation to abandon my train of
thought, I take ten seconds to piece things together.
...Now that I think about it―――or rather, no matter
how much I consider it―――there's no way I can
explain the events of the past two days.
<Page17>
Absence without official leave. Violation of curfew.
And to top it off, a complete lack of communication.
Akiha is scary enough when I don't come home before
dusk. I shudder to think what kind of face she's making
right now.
<Page18>
"...Hey, Hisui.
Would it be an exaggeration to say that Akiha is
angry...?"
<Page19>
"Hmm, who's to say?
You will have to find that out for yourself,
Shiki-sama."
<Page20>
Okay. Hisui's tone also comes off as somewhat cold and
dispassionate.
If this is how it's going to be, I should have returned
to the mansion even if I had to crawl―――
Even if I... had to crawl?
<Page21>
"Wait, hold up.
Before that, why was I asleep in my room...?"
"You returned to the mansion last night a little after
two o'clock in the morning.
I am told that Nee-san discovered you asleep at the
front door, and brought you to your room."
<Page22>
"――――――――"
...My mouth hangs wide open.
Coming home late at night after total radio silence.
Falling asleep in the entryway after being unable to
make it to my room. I'm like some feral drunk who
missed the last train.
<Page23>
"That woman, treating people the same way you would a
cat or something..."
Arcueid's face springs to mind.
...Well, I guess I should at least be grateful that she
carried me as far as the doorway.
<Page24>
In any case, I understand the situation now.
"I'll go there right away, so if you could, well... ask
Akiha to calm down as best you can, it'd be much
appreciated..."
<Page25>
"I am deeply sorry. For a number of reasons, I must
refuse that order."
<Page26>
Hisui replies firmly.
It's clear to see that my standing within the Tohno
household has plummeted to the lowest of the lumpen.
Since Akiha is the head of the mansion, it's no
surprise I have no allies when she's upset.
<Page27>
...That being said, I should get up.
It's no use staying in bed forever.
<Page28>
"―――"
O―――uch.
As soon as I stand up, a tearing pain races through my
legs.
<Page29>
...So that's how it is. If I were to ask myself what I
should be surprised about, it would be the fact that
I'm still alive.
After doing all those crazy things, of course greeting
a morning like this feels unnatural.
<Page30>
"Shiki-sama...?
Is everything alright? You are... sweating, heavily."
<Page31>
A copious amount of sweat is forming on my forehead.
It seems that just the pain of trying to walk is enough
to cause my body to react like this.
<Page32>
"...If you are not feeling well, perhaps you would
prefer to rest for a little while longer.
You cried out a little earlier, but if I were to put in
a word with Akiha-sama..."
<Page33>
"No, it's alright. It's just a sprain, it'll go away
soon.
Besides, I'm much more worried about Akiha than my leg.
If I keep making her wait, she'll just get even
angrier."
"――――――"
<Page34>
Hisui's eyes are full of reproach, as if asking me not
to tell lies.
However, due to her position, she cannot press me about
it.
...I'm really sorry, but right now I've no choice but
to rely on this obvious subterfuge to make you agree.
<Page35>
"I'll head down to the lobby once I'm dressed.
It won't take long, so just wait for me in the
hallway."
<Page36>
"...As you wish.
I humbly ask that you not push yourself too hard."
<Page37>
Hisui bows deeply and leaves the room.
I change out of my pajamas and into some casual
clothes, trying to move my body as little as possible.
My first weekend at home after seven years away is
already off to a rocky start.
