Hisui is waiting for me in the hallway.
The pain in my left leg is enough to make me want to
scream with every step.
Although my entire body feels heavy, it's only a slight
muscle ache. It's not actually all that painful.
<Page2>
I felt around with my hands to confirm, but it seems
that the cuts I received on my cheeks and shoulders
from Vlov's ice shards have completely healed.
The unnatural lack of any scars makes it clear that
this is Arcueid's handiwork. She did say that she would
treat me after all.
<Page3>
"Shiki-sama. My apologies for being so forward, but
please make use of this."
"Hm?"
<Page4>
Hisui timidly presents a long, narrow rod.
It's a cane... no, a crutch.
<Page5>
"Oh, this is perfect."
"Yes. I had remembered seeing it in the equipment room
previously. I searched for it while holding on to that
sliver of hope."
<Page6>
'Sliver of hope' is a bit of an exaggeration... I smile
at the turn of phrase before noticing that Hisui's
breathing is a little elevated.
She must have hurried to fetch it during the small time
window while I was changing.
<Page7>
"Thank you. To be honest, I felt as if my leg was about
to fall off with every step. This is a lifesaver."
"Of course. I am glad to be of service."
<Page8>
I shift the weight of my body off of my left leg, and
onto my left hand through the crutch.
With this, I can walk without issue. I thank Hisui once
again for her thoughtfulness, and together we head for
the lobby.
<Page9>
―――Well, we've arrived.
<Page10>
I lean the crutch up against the wall beside the door.
Straight ahead, on the other side of this door, is the
head of the Tohno family: Akiha-sama... She may be a
year younger... yet now she impatiently lies in wait
for her pitiful older brother to make his excuses to
her.
I may as well be entering hell itself.
<Page11>
No, complaining won't solve anything.
These are the consequences of my own actions.
Regardless of the circumstances, I was absent from
school without permission for one day and didn't return
home for two.
It's no wonder Akiha demands an explanation.
<Page12>
In this situation, I should―――
C:> Apologize sincerely.
C:> Try to fool her.
C:> Tell her the truth.
