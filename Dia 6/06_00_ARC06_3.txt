Having finished lunch, it's now the afternoon.
Thanks to this morning's medical exam, I'm able to at
least walk around without much trouble.
Given that I can't go too far, how shall I spend my
afternoon?
C:> I'll take a walk around the courtyard.
C:> I'll wander the halls of the mansion.
C:> I'll take a quick trip into the city.
