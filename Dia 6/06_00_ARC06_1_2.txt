I guess I have no choice but to try and deceive her
somehow.
Besides, even if I did tell her the truth about Arcueid
and Vlov, there's no way she'd believe me.
I'll have to just avoid telling her the truth, while
also keeping the number of outright lies to a minimum.
<Page2>
"―――Alright, here we go."
Taking a deep breath, I open the door to the living
room.
<Page3>
Inside the living room, Akiha is sitting on the sofa,
and Hisui is standing attentively by the wall.
<Page4>
"Good morning, Nii-san.
Contrary to my expectations, you seem to have a rather
refreshed look on your face. Did some brilliant idea
just occur to you?"
<Page5>
"―――#."
I can't tell whether I should interpret Akiha's
preemptive strike as merely a snide comment, or as a
maneuver to cut off my avenues of escape.
<Page6>
"Y-Yeah. Morning, Akiha.
...Is it okay... if I sit there?"
I point to the sofa across from Akiha.
<Page7>
"Please feel free to do so... Hmm. It seems as though
you are willing to come quietly and confess."
<Page8>
". Oh stop, you make it sound as though I've been
up to no good."
"―――As though?"
"I'll sit down now."
<Page9>
Cowed by her words, I sit down on the sofa.
The head of the family really is frightening.
<Page10>
"........."
Akiha keeps her mouth shut.
I get the feeling she's expecting me to take the
initiative... Or rather, that she won't forgive me if I
don't start talking.
<Page11>
A judge pressuring a confession out of the defendant.
But I've already decided on a plan. I'm going to win
this trial.
<Page12>
"I'm sorry I didn't come home yesterday or the day
before.
I had some urgent business to attend to."
<Page13>
"Urgent business, you say. If it wouldn't be too much
trouble, could you possibly enlighten me as to the
nature of this business?"
<Page14>
"Well, I ran into a minor acquaintance of mine out of
nowhere, one thing led to another, and eventually I
ended up showing them around town."
"Hmm. A minor acquaintance, you say?"
<Page15>
"Yeah. Although I only met them recently.
You see, they weren't feeling well, but still had some
extremely urgent matters to take care of. I couldn't
just turn my back on them."
<Page16>
"And so you skipped school and stayed out without
permission, correct?
What a wonderful deed you've done. So wonderful, in
fact, that it ought to be stuffed and put on display in
a museum."
<Page17>
Akiha's gaze is ice cold.
The look in her eyes isn't so much one of anger as one
of utter disgust.
...Wait. Does that mean she's bought it? That she's
accepted my hand-wavy explanation as the truth?
<Page18>
"........."
"........."
The silence drags on.
I try not to expose myself any further,
while Akiha mulls over how best to pick apart my
explanation.
<Page19>
"And so, who might this acquaintance be?"
"Huh?"
"I asked exactly who this acquaintance of yours is."
<Page20>
Akiha stares straight into my eyes.
It's crystal clear that she absolutely will not let
herself be fooled.
<Page21>
"Well, that's―――"
"If you cannot tell me, then there must be something
you feel guilty about, Nii-san."
<Page22>
Akiha's sharp gaze bores into me.
I feel as though I'd be set upon the second I avert my
eyes, so I resolutely stare back at her face.
<Page23>
...Well, not that it really matters.
But looking at her with fresh eyes like this, I come to
realize how much Akiha has really changed.
I wonder if it's brotherly stupidity to be fascinated
by one's own sister.
<Page24>
Akiha has a dignified posture, a clear tone of voice,
and eyes that never waver. Even though she has
possessed these qualities ever since she was a child,
the person in front of me now is rather―――
<Page25>
"Hey, Akiha."
"Yes? ...What is it, Nii-san?"
"You have rather thick eyebrows, don't you?"
"Huh?!"
<Page26>
Akiha leaps to her feet, banging her shin against the
table as she does so.
<Page27>
"No, on second thought, thick isn't the right word.
Maybe they just give off that impression since they're
all tensed up? It's not healthy to furrow your brow so
much, you know."
She may be a powerful and beautiful woman, but a scowl
like that would send a normal man running.
<Page28>
"It would appear that you have no intention of
answering me seriously."
"That's not true at all. Though you'll just have to
take my word for it, I swear I would never lie to you."
It's just that there are a lot of things I can't say.
<Page29>
".... It's true, you're not the type to lie.
It's always been hard to tell whether you're being
honest or dishonest."
<Page30>
"Really? I don't remember that much about the past."
"It's fine if you don't remember.
...It seems like I haven't changed either.
Interrogating you like this when I knew how it was
going to pan out... perhaps I haven't matured at all."
