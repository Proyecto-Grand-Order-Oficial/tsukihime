<Page1>
I'll have Kohaku-san take care of me.
A compress and some painkillers should be all I need.
<Page2>
"Understood. In that case, please wait in your room
after finishing your meal.
I will be headed out this afternoon as there is a
reception I must attend, and so while it is true that I
will not be here to keep an eye on you, I would humbly
request that you still show some restraint, Nii-san."
<Page3>
I'm not sure what she's so happy about, but Akiha has a
relieved-looking smile on her face.
...Now then.
My first priority is breakfast, but once that's dealt
with, I'll go and get myself looked at.
<Page4>
"Thank you for waiting!"
 Kohaku-san comes in holding a retro wooden box.
<Page5>
"Sorry about this, Kohaku-san. Making you go out of
your way when you're already so busy."
"Not at all. Since today is a holiday, there's not much
work to be done so please don't fret over it.
And besides, you called for me yourself. So long as
you'll have me, I'm always ready to be of service."
<Page6>
Kohaku-san makes her way over to the bed with an
energetic smile on her face.
<Page7>
"Without further ado, it is time for your examination.
Please take a seat on the bed. As for the extent of
your injuries...# I see, so it's not just your left leg,
but your entire lower body, right?"
<Page8>
"Wow... you can tell that much at a glance?"
"Yes, that much at least is obvious. I may not have a
license, but I've been training to become both a
pharmacist and osteopath ever since I was a child."
<Page9>
Pharmacology and osteopathy... So this is what Akiha
meant when she said Kohaku-san deals in 'internal
medicine'.
I sit down on the bed, and roll up my pants so that she
can begin her examination.
<Page10>
Kohaku-san gently palpates my leg. Every time her
fingers brush across my shin, the pain makes me want to
scream.
And then...
<Page11>
"Um... Shiki-san?
Is there any chance that you may have fractured your
leg?"
<Page12>
Ah... So that's how it is.
Though I'm glad that it's only a fracture.
I honestly wouldn't be surprised if I had quite a few
fractures here and there.
<Page13>
"I suppose it's possible. But it's just a small one!
Probably.
After all, I've been able to put up with it just fine
so far."
<Page14>
".... I think I'm starting to understand how
Akiha-sama feels. Yet despite your face looking so
calm... No, rather, it's when you look this calm that
you must be suffering the most, right?
Please hold on for just a minute, I need to run and
fetch some of my prize ointments and other sundries.
You'd better stay right where you are until I come
back, okay?"
<Page15>
Kohaku-san walks out of the room with pattering
footsteps.
...Left alone, I start to feel a strange sense of
guilt.
To think that even someone as cheerful as Kohaku-san
would speak in such a subdued tone.
<Page16>
Kohaku-san's treatment is more orthodox than I
expected.
After applying the ointment, she tapes up my heel to
hold it in place and then applies a plaster cast that
extends all the way up my shin.
<Page17>
"Hold on, there's no need to go overboard here."
"There most certainly is.
Just what are you thinking, treating your own body like
this?
Besides, how did you even get this injury in the first
place? As someone who is responsible for your
well-being, I cannot overlook this matter."
<Page18>
"Uh... Well, you see..."
"Shiki-san. Please be honest with me."
"It was... A fight, more or less. Things got a little
heated and we ended up coming to blows."
<Page19>
It's a poor excuse, but there's not really any other
way I can explain it.
Kohaku-san seemed so earnestly worried about me that I
couldn't bring myself to lie and say that nothing
happened.
<Page20>
"A fight? Geez, you ought to know better than to get
mixed up in something like that.
I think it is okay to be naughty, but violence is a
no-go! It only ends in tears, not just for the person
that's hit but also for the person that raised their
fist."
<Page21>
"........."
It hurts both the person that hits and the person who's
hit, huh.
Kohaku-san's words have an oddly poignant weight to
them.
<Page22>
"...Yeah. I guess you're right. I suppose that fighting
does only end in pain."
"Right? And yet you've gone and gotten yourself injured
like this. I'm disappointed.
I don't care what the circumstances may be. If you keep
this up, I'll have to reevaluate my opinion of you."
"...Yeah, I'm reflecting on how stupid I was too. I'll
work hard to make sure this never happens again."
<Page23>
"Yes, it's alright as long as you understand.
Now that that's settled, I'm going to move on and
examine your upper body, so please take off your
clothes for me."
"―――Excuse me?"
<Page24>
Moving with purpose, Kohaku-san stands up and takes a
firm grip on the shirt I'm wearing.
In short, she's ordering me to get naked right here in
front of her.
<Page25>
"W-Wait a minute!
You've already done more than enough, it's only my legs
that hurt!"
<Page26>
"What are you saying?
Your legs are certainly in poor shape, but I'd argue
that your shoulders and hips are even worse off. Look,
you even have some light inflammation over here."
<Page27>
"?! What the heck was that? A pressure point?! Wait,
that vicious hand technique―――don't tell me your
osteopathy instructor was that old bastard from the
Jinan Clinic!?"
<Page28>
"Indeed. I had Dr. Jinan give me a thorough run-down on
your body, Shiki-san.# And please, it's not vicious.
Just call it some dextrous finger placement, okay ♡"
<Page29>
"Wha―――!"
She knocked me face down onto the bed like it was
nothing...!
Dr. Jinan is a local osteopath who took care of me
while I was living with the Arimas.
Even now, he's right at the top of the list of people I
owe a great deal to. That said, he's also at the top of
the list of people I want to beat up someday.
<Page30>
"No, that's not the point! If it's inflamed, I can put
a compress on it myself! There's no need for me to get
naked!"
"―――. You're embarassed, aren't you, Shiki-san?"
With a satisfied grin, Kohaku-san ignores my protests
and starts to take off my shirt.
<Page31>
"Besides, I'm already used to seeing your body. It's no
big deal, so please just resign yourself to it.
I even changed your clothes for you last night. I know
everything, right down to the location of the mole on
your back."
<Page32>
"――――――"
Now that she mentions it, I was in my pajamas when I
woke up, not my school uniform!
<Page33>
"Come on, don't struggle so much.
Otherwise, that cast on your leg that I worked so hard
on will come off."
<Page34>
...There's not much I can say to that. But even so,
being naked in front of Kohaku-san is a bit...
<Page35>
"Geez. I guess there's nothing for it then. I'll limit
my examination to just your back. There shouldn't be
anything embarrassing about that, right?"
<Page36>
It's still more than a little embarrassing, but it's
the best deal I'm going to get.
If I wanted to put a compress on my back, I'd have to
get someone to do it for me anyway.
<Page37>
"...I guess so. In that case, I'll leave it to you."
I resign myself and relax.
"I will apply some disinfectant as well to be on the
safe side. If you've been in a fight, there's a chance
you have a few small nicks and scrapes as a result."
<Page38>
The antiseptic stings my skin.
The past two days were really something. I'm sure I
picked up some bumps and grazes along the way without
noticing.
<Page39>
The antiseptic stings, but it's nothing compared to the
dizziness from my anemia. Plus, every time she daubs on
some more―――
"Wow, so manly!"
―――Kohaku-san praises me, which may have made it a
little easier to put up with the extra pain.
<Page40>
And with that, Kohaku-san's examination comes to a
close.
After the examination, which lasted for an hour and was
much more professional than I had expected, I'm struck
once again by how amazing this person is.
<Page41>
"Thank you, Kohaku-san. Now that the pain in my left
leg is gone, I can relax and enjoy the rest of the
afternoon."
<Page42>
"Don't mention it, the pleasure is all mine.
If that's all, I will return to work now.
If the pain does not go away, or if it gets worse,
please let me know right away. I will be in the kitchen
this afternoon preparing dinner."
With an energetic parting smile, Kohaku-san leaves the
room.
<Page43>
Well then.
I should also figure out what to do this afternoon...
