"I understand. I will refrain from pursuing this matter
any further.
After all, I am partially to blame for the fact that
you did not contact us."
"Huh? I don't see how any of this is your fault."
<Page2>
<Page3>
"I understand. I will refrain from pursuing this matter
any further.
After all, I am partially to blame for the fact that
you did not contact us."
"Huh? I don't see how any of this is your fault."
<Page4>
"Huh? I don't see how any of this is your fault."
<Page5>
"I was the one who took away your cell phone.
If you'd had that, surely even a negligent brother such
as yourself would have at least tried to contact me,
don't you think?"
<Page6>
"――――――"
Well... no, but actually...
My phone... has already been surreptitiously
returned...
<Page7>
"However,# let this be the last time. Please refrain
from such conduct in the future. After all, you are the
sole male of the Tohno household. It will be
problematic if you do not start taking your role a
little more seriously.
If our reputation were to be damaged, it would affect
the ability of the Tohno family to network in the
future."
<Page8>
Future networking... does she mean between me and some
other prestigious family?
<Page9>
"Well, surely it's not that much of an issue. It's not
as though any of our relatives have taken an interest
in my affairs.
Besides, you're the one that's actually the successor
of the Tohno family. If you're worried about that sort
of thing, you could always ship me off somewhere and
find yourself a man more befitting the family name."
"―――――"
<Page10>
...?
Akiha has fallen silent for some reason.
"What's wrong? Are you not feeling well, Akiha?"
<Page11>
"I am fine. If you can afford to worry about me, please
take better care of yourself instead.
After all, you are the one with chronic anemia,
Nii-san."
"...Mmm."
She's right. I do collapse from anemia rather
frequently.
<Page12>
"In any case, please do not leave the mansion alone too
often.
I'm sure you know without me saying that the city has
become quite dangerous lately. People such as yourself
that go about with their heads in the clouds are
practically begging to be targeted by the serial
killer."
<Page13>
"If that's what you're worried about, then it's okay.
Those kinds of incidents will never happen again."
<Page14>
The serial killings that had the city in an uproar.
The culprit that the news referred to as the modern-day
vampire, his whereabouts and identity still unknown
even to this day, the shadow of the night that menaces
the people of Souya.
However, all of that is now in the past.
<Page15>
"――――Huh?"
"I mean that there's no more vampire. The killer has
already been caught."
<Page16>
"So be it, I suppose.# That is good news indeed, but...
Nii-san, you sure seem to know a lot about this."
"Y-Yeah. I just happened to be at the scene of the
arrest is all."
<Page17>
I laugh at the ridiculousness of my own statement.
I suppose it really was all just a series of
coincidences.
<Page18>
The two days I spent with Arcueid.
So much happened that even now it feels like it was all
a dream, but at least the monster that had been nesting
in the city is gone.
On that point at least, I think I can say with pride
that everything is taken care of.
<Page19>
"Nii-san? What is going on, you look so happy all of a
sudden."
"It's nothing special.
It's just that, I finally realized that it's all over."
<Page20>
With a smile on my face, I unthinkingly let those words
slip out.
It seems that this explanation was enough for Akiha.
I thank her and stand up.
<Page21>
"Well, now that that's all off my chest, I'm starving.
Is it alright if I go and get some breakfast?"
<Page22>
"T-There is no need for you to ask me for permission.
I don't have any interest in micromanaging your
breakfast, so please go enjoy it at your leisure. If
you're looking for Kohaku, she's probably preparing
breakfast in the kitchen."
"Thank you. I'll go help myself then."
<Page23>
I start walking toward the doorway.
... As expected, my left leg still hurts.
<Page24>
"Stop right there, Nii-san.
I thought I noticed something earlier, but now it's
quite apparent. You've hurt your leg, haven't you?"
<Page25>
"Ah... Well, I probably just sprained it, or maybe
pulled a muscle. It's not that big of a deal, so don't
worry about it."
"Is that so. Not a big deal, you say."
<Page26>
Akiha strides over to me purposefully.
Then, without hesitating, she makes eye contact and
casually―――
<Page27>
"There."
"!?"
She stomps right on the most swollen part of my left
foot. Her aim is so accurate that you'd think she had a
sixth sense for locating injuries―――!
<Page28>
"Oh my, what a surprise. It would appear that even your
poker face crumbles under a judicious application of
pain."
<Page29>
"Of course it does! Hey hold on, I'm the one that's
surprised here!
You knew what you were doing, didn't you!?"
<Page30>
"No no, you misunderstand. My big brother told me that
it wasn't a serious injury and so I, with full faith in
his words, put my best foot forward to confirm."
<Page31>
My demonic sister smiles gracefully as she giggles.
What the hell, could she  any more transparent? This
is clearly payback for me not telling her what I was
doing.
<Page32>
Acting as though nothing had happened, yet with a new
spring in her step, Akiha returns to the sofa and
elegantly sips her tea.
<Page33>
"Well then. You are correct in that it isn't a
particularly serious injury, but it still won't do to
just leave it alone."
<Page34>
"Nii-san, I am ordering you as the head of the family.
Please have a doctor take a look at you as soon as
you've finished your breakfast. Regardless of how you
got hurt, I can't have you just moping around in pain."
<Page35>
"Sure, that would be great, but... don't you want to
ask me how I got hurt?"
<Page36>
"I am not interested. I've no doubt that the reason is
utterly asinine. Besides, even if I were to ask, I get
the impression you wouldn't tell me, would you,
Nii-san?"
A blunt reply from the head of the family.
<Page37>
"If it's merely a sprain and not a gaping wound, Kohaku
can take care of it.
Oh... That's right, I believe Arach-sensei is around
this morning as well.
She was originally a surgeon.
Kohaku for medical treatment, or Arach-sensei for
surgery.
Please choose whichever you please."
<Page38>
...What an unexpected turn of events.
I―――
C:> Have Kohaku-san take care of me.
C:> Have Professor Arach take care of me.
