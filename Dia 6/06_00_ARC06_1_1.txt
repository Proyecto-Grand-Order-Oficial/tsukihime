<Page1>
"...Yeah. I think that's the best way to do it."
<Page2>
I can't talk about Arcueid or Vlov.
It's not like she would understand, and I don't want
her to get involved.
Though I absolutely cannot tell her the truth, I can at
least apologize sincerely for my failings.
<Page3>
"―――Alright, here we go."
Taking a deep breath, I open the door to the living
room.
<Page4>
"Good morning,# Nii-san.#It's strange, but I feel as though it's been quite some
time since I last saw you."#
Um... Well, isn't she coming in a little hot?
<Page5>
"Y-Yo. Morning, Akiha."
"There is no need for greetings, so please take a seat
over there.
Indeed, it seems that we have a lot to catch up on,
don't you think?"
<Page6>
"........."
...Is it just my imagination, or does it look like
she's having fun?
She must be. I'm like a deer caught in the headlights.
Perhaps it'd be a good idea to just respond with an
appropriate greeting and then retreat.
<Page7>
"―――Nii-san?"
"Y-Yeah, I'll take a seat right away!"
<Page8>
A single glare from Akiha was enough to dash my naïve
thoughts of escape.
I sit down on the sofa slowly, holding back the pain in
my left leg.
<Page9>
"I'm seated now."
"You did not need to say that... Please do not dampen
my spirit with your bizarre attitude. It's unfair."
<Page10>
"Why would it be unfair?"
"Of course it's unfair. If you make that face at me,
I'll let my guard do――――#."
<Page11>
After truncating her statement with a cough, Akiha
glares at me with an even sharper gaze than before.
<Page12>
"Nii-san. I know this is sudden, but would you mind
elucidating for me  what you have been up to
both yesterday and the day before?"
<Page13>
As she eloquently makes her remarks, Akiha picks up her
teacup.
Though her sentence was phrased as a question, there's
no mistaking the fact that it is actually an order.
But, as her older brother, I can't let her hear about
what actually transpired. I would much rather have her
hate me than worry about me.
<Page14>
"So, about that, Akiha."
"Yes, what is it?"
"To be frank, I can't explain the situation."
<Page15>
.
At that, the teacup that Akiha was holding fell onto
the table.
No, it's more accurate to say that she dropped it on
purpose.
<Page16>
"Akiha-sama―――"
"Oh, I apologize, Hisui. Could you clean that up for
me?"
<Page17>
What a terrifying voice.
Hisui silently cleans up the spilled tea and the
broken... very expensive looking... teacup.
Still, what an utterly terrifying voice.
After she finishes cleaning up, Hisui leaves the living
room.
<Page18>
"―――So then, Nii-san."
"...What?"
"Would you be so inclined as to tell me more about the
events of these past two days?"
<Page19>
Have I gone back in time?
The head of the family is determined to make me talk.
<Page20>
...But even so, I can't talk to her about the
situation.
Even if it's for my own sake, I can't tell Akiha.
There's no way I can let her hear such a tale.
<Page21>
"...No matter how many times you ask, I still can't
tell you.
It was wrong of me to cause you needless worry. I also
apologize for not getting in touch. But even so, there
are some things that I cannot talk about."
<Page22>
"So you claim that you feel bad, and yet you won't say
anything, Nii-san.
Do you not even have an excuse?"
<Page23>
"...No, well..."
As much as I'd like to explain myself―――
<Page24>
"I don't have a good excuse...
But I haven't done anything wrong in the past two
days... That, I want to believe in."
<Page25>
...That's right. Those two days were nothing but kill
or be killed.
Despite that, I want to believe that I made the right
choice.
I wanted to help Arcueid, true, but even putting that
reason aside, I still have no regrets about killing
that vampire.
I may not have acted fast enough, and that may have
cost lives, but at least from now on, nobody will die
as a result of having their blood sucked.
<Page26>
"...Sorry, Akiha.
I know it's frustrating, but please don't ask any more
questions."
<Page27>
"―――――――"
Akiha stares into my eyes.
The suffocating atmosphere persists for a little while
longer.
<Page28>
"So be it, I suppose.
Come to think of it, you do have your own set of
circumstances, and it is not my place to meddle deeply
with your affairs."
"...Sorry. I really appreciate you saying that."
"――――――"
