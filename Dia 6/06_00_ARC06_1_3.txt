<Page1>
Of course, I should just tell her the truth!
I don't want to deceive Akiha, and there's no way I'd
be able to sneak some half-baked lie past her even if I
tried.
<Page2>
Yep, honesty is the best policy, after all. I'm sure
Akiha will understand if I earnestly explain all the
details to her.
I was a little panicked before, but I've come to my
senses.
<Page3>
"―――Okay, here we go."
From here on, it's all about freaking guts.
I take a deep breath and open the door to the living
room.
<Page4>
"Good morning, Nii-san.
It's strange, but I feel as though it's been quite some
time since―――"
<Page5>
"Yo. Morning, Akiha."
<Page6>
I deflect Akiha's 'I am angry' scowl with my smiling
face (+50 DEF), and take a seat across from her.
My heel hurts a lot, but I just grin and bear it.
<Page7>
"I forgot to say it while we were in my room, but good
morning to you too, Hisui.
Thanks for earlier. I'll be counting on you from now
on."
<Page8>
I also express my gratitude to Hisui, who is standing
at attention by the wall.
Who would have thought that deciding to be upfront
about everything would lead to such a perfect morning
gambit? I better make a note of this.
<Page9>
"Y-You seem to be in very high spirits.
I had thought for sure that you would have reflected on
your abysmal behavior these past few days and curled up
in shame, but..."
<Page10>
"Of course I reflect on my behavior. I'm self-aware
after all.
But that has no bearing on my good mood. I'm just happy
because I get to see your face first thing in the
morning."
"――――――#W―"
<Page11>
Akiha freezes like a statue.
Crap... did I upset her?
I see. It seems that being too honest is also
problematic. I'd better update my notes.
<Page12>
"Akiha-sama."
"―――It's nothing, Hisui.
However, that was a splendid greeting just now."
<Page13>
After clearing her throat, Akiha exhales deeply and
composes herself.
<Page14>
"Nii-san. I should warn you now, you cannot fool me
with such honeyed words."
"Honeyed words huh."
<Page15>
"You cannot fool me with regular words either.
What I really want to hear is a report of precisely
where you have been and what you have been up to for
the past two days."
<Page16>
"So, about that, Akiha."
"Yes. What kind of excuse will you give me this time,
Nii-san?"
<Page17>
"It's a long story, but I'll do my best to keep it
short.
For the past two days, I've been eradicating a vampire.
You know about the spree of serial killings that have
been happening in Souya, right? Well, it turned out the
killer was a vampire, but I was saved by a 'good
vampire' I happened to run into.
And so, to return the favor, I joined forces with them
and fought against the 'bad vampire'."
<Page18>
"―――――――"
Akiha is utterly motionless.
It's only to be expected. I can easily imagine her
yelling:
<Page19>
"Are you making fun of me, Nii-san!?"
―――something like that any moment now.
<Page20>
But there was no other way to say it.
It's unfortunate, but it's clear she won't believe me.
I'll just accept my title as 'the brother who makes
terrible excuses'...
<Page21>
"............"
...?
On a scale from zero to upset, Akiha definitely seems
angry, but she isn't saying anything.
<Page22>
"Hello, earth to Akiha?"
"Nii-san. Was that some kind of sick joke just now?"
"――――――"
In complete silence, Akiha peers through... no, pierces
through my heart with her gaze.
<Page23>
"...No, I'm not kidding―――"
"This is a joke, right?"
"...Well, I can't blame you for taking it that way, I
guess."
She's so adamant about it that I end up agreeing with
her.
<Page24>
"Very well. But in the future, please refrain from
spouting such absurdities, even as a joke.
Our relatives have eyes and ears everywhere. I do not
wish to hear any rumors about you being unfit for your
role as the eldest son of the Tohno family."
<Page25>
...Akiha is neither angry nor disappointed.
Though her gaze may be cold, I can tell she's looking
out for me.
Just then, that was... how should I put it... a pure
and earnest desire, as steadfast as if it were made of
steel.
<Page26>
"I'm sorry. Forget what I just said. I took the joke a
little too far."
<Page27>
"...It is fine. I will not press you on this matter any
further.
After all, I am partially to blame for the fact that
you did not contact us."
