A block of ice flies through the air.
The ice forms a spear, a missile fired to blow my
brains out.
―――Should I avoid it, or take it head-on?
Do I continue to hide it, or do I cast away my only
weapon?
I make my decision subconsciously.
<Page2>
"―――!"
My headache clamps down further on my brain.
Fully immersed, I focus my eyes on the deadly weapon.
If those lines represent the 'death of existence'―――
Then I will kill the form, the inertia, and the
sub-zero bonds of the spear right in front of me...!
<Page3>
Death grazes my temple.
I match my knife to the soaring icicles. Man is but a
wild beast. We were equipped with such kinetic vision
and reflexes long ago.
<Page4>
If my body can still move adequately, then a weapon
like this is no different from a giant pebble.
However―――
<Page5>
However, this brings an end to my frontal 'surprise
attack'.
The man's eyes speak to me.
They tell me that he saw it.
They tell me that things like reason and logic don't
matter. He simply won't let a bastard like me get close
a second time.
<Page6>
With that, I've lost my path to victory.
I wonder to myself if it was really the right time to
discard my trump card.
―――It wasn't.
But there was no other way.
The only way to survive was to expose my hand here.
That's why I have to search with my entire being for
what I can get in return.
<Page7>
"―――!"
I cut it down with the least amount of movement
possible.
Even if there's no way to get close to him, I'll still
try to conserve as much energy as I can.
<Page8>
Two minutes left until I reach my limit.
―――The excitement drives away my fear.
My view of life and death is reversed by my desperate
struggle to survive.
<Page9>
"This is not a miracle...
But neither does this follow common sense.
Why is it that he is able to slip like water through my
onslaught?"
<Page10>
There is a small gap in the icy barrage.
The man concentrates the cold waves flooding out of
himself into a single point, creating an even colder
vortex.
<Page11>
"It's a shame, but... die.
Don't go and... make my heart... pound like that."
Chunks of ice shoot toward me as though gliding down a
zip line, cutting through the frozen atmosphere.
<Page12>
I slice through the assassin's bullets.
As long as I'm standing in front of Arcueid, I have no
choice but to stop the objects that are being fired in
our direction.
<Page13>
At this range, it takes 1.5 seconds for the ice spears
to reach me.
I can keep this up for as long as my body can keep
moving.
In the meantime, I'll think of what I can do.
<Page14>
Vlov hasn't taken a single step.
Why is he not moving? If he thinks I'm a threat, then
there's no reason to ease up. If anything, it should be
the opposite. I predict that it's not because he
doesn't  to move thanks to his projectiles, but
rather that he  move when he's in this state.
<Page15>
He was driven into a corner by Arcueid and ran out of
the blood that fuels him. That cold air must be the
final self-defense mechanism of a monster on the verge
of death.
<Page16>
It's a wild theory but the logic makes sense.
The immobilized Vlov protects himself by deploying a
curse in all directions.
Regardless of whether it's hot or cold, any living
thing that comes close to him will die.
<Page17>
You would freeze to death in two seconds if you got
within ten meters of him.
At this rate, I'll eventually fall as well. It's the
same as humans stranded in the snow-capped mountains
succumbing to sleep. When a human's body temperature is
below 34℃ or above 43℃, their brain cells shut down
and they fall unconscious.
<Page18>
Rather than focusing solely on Vlov, I observe his
surroundings.
Without interrupting my thoughts, I let the blade slide
out automatically the moment I see something.
<Page19>
―――As I do, I revise the conjecture that I had made
earlier.
That cold wave is spreading in all directions.
But is the density really as uniform as I thought?
<Page20>
The fact that the floor is the coldest area means that
there is a temperature gradient. Whether it's
fundamentally strong or weak,  fault exists.
It may protect him from all directions, but that
doesn't mean his invulnerability is uniformly
perfect―――
<Page21>
"So you protect your master on the brink of death.
Brave... but futile."
The long lance that struck down Arcueid is drawn from
the shadows once again.
Perhaps he was just warming up before, because behind
him, a great tree of ice sprouts branches―――
"―――Now. I will release, in great numbers...!"
<Page22>
I put my thoughts on hold and pour all of my attention
into intercepting his attack.
This is impossible. I can't stop them all.
I'll surely be hit somewhere. ―――No.
I can't be so naïve.
I can't even let them graze me.
If I bleed out, it's over. The cold air will not spare
even a single minute before coming for my life.
That's why I must kill. That's why I must struggle.
I clear my mind and tune out everything in my vision
other than the 'lines'.
<Page23>
Total number of prey deployed: twenty-six.
I continue to stare as I develop a strategy for what to
cut first and what to avoid.
―――Within that gap, I can see it clearly.
The place of death greater than a line.
That spot must be the focality of death that gives
birth to the lines.
<Page24>
"―――."
The wall of death looms before me.
But I saw it. What I saw just now, I've seen it before.
There's a chance that I die here.
But there's a chance that bastard dies here too...!
"!"
<Page25>
But I've come to a conclusion.
I, Tohno Shiki, no longer have a means of survival.
The ice spears cut into the flesh of my right flank and
my left thigh.
My body heat is drained through my extremities.
My ligaments scream from all my sudden stops and
starts.
The cells in my legs are being destroyed by the
ultra-low temperatures.
My fingertips grow numb. My limbs don't move as I want
them to.
<Page26>
"――――――"
An inevitable predicament.
A losing battle with no chance for victory.
A situation where I will die in a minute, no matter
what.
Neither Vlov, nor Arcueid, nor whoever else happens to
watch this mess unfold, will doubt my inevitable death.
Above all, I myself have no hope for my own survival.
And yet―――
<Page27>
"――――――."
An animalistic urge sprouts from deep within me.
Why am I smiling# at a time like this?
<Page28>
"!?"
One of the ice spears strikes Arcueid square in the
face.
Damn. I didn't even consider the fact that she was
located behind me.
<Page29>
Although it didn't pierce her, Arcueid rubs her face
with one hand.
How is this woman unhurt after taking a direct hit to
the face?
<Page30>
"...!"
I knew that she was a nonsensical creature, but once
again, I'm speechless.
Arcueid plunges her bare hand into the ground and lifts
a chunk of earth, as though scooping it up with a
shovel.
<Page31>
She then aims the bedrock at Vlov and throws it as if
to say 'that didn't hurt at all'.
<Page32>
The huge lance crushes the bedrock thrown by Arcueid.
Vlov is unharmed.
No surprise, you can't kill him with such a simple
attack.
―――However.
With Arcueid's counterattack, the final piece has been
placed.
<Page33>
We have already come to a conclusion.
There is only one way to kill him. If I can get close
enough before the cold wave stops my body, I can kill
him with absolute certainty.
<Page34>
But how?
My legs are too slow to be able to close that distance
in two seconds. I need the help of something faster.
If we want to be more certain, I need to invade through
the weakest section of his ultra-cold sphere. I cannot
simply use my own legs for this.
<Page35>
I will die for sure if I do nothing. I have no choice.
It's not a matter of  I can kill him.
It's a matter of  I can kill him.
<Page36>
I must steel my resolve.
If there is any way to get close, it's by...
C:> ...Throwing.
C:> ...Gliding.
C:> ...Towing.
