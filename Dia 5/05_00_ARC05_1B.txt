<Page1>
"Are you up, Shiki?"
Arcueid pokes her head out of the kitchen.
<Page2>
". What's with that scary face, did something
happen?"
Arcueid casually calls out to me with a light-hearted
tone.
<Page3>
"N-No. It's nothing. Uhh... well, g-good morning."
<Page4>
"Yeah, good morning!
. I don't get to exchange morning greetings with
someone very often."
<Page5>
"――――――"
Her unexpected smile takes my breath away.
The chilling thoughts I had a moment ago disappear with
it.
<Page6>
Wait, what am I doing spacing out!
Wasn't the whole reason I got up because she wasn't in
bed!?
<Page7>
"Arcueid, is your wound okay?"
"Wound?# Yeah, it should be fine for now."
<Page8>
Arcueid stands there, looking comfortable.
She looks like she's entirely back to normal. Hell, she
might even be healthier than I am.
<Page9>
"I see... I'm glad to hear that―――"
I'm glad that at least the people close to me are safe.
"Hmm...?"
No, what am I thinking?
Arcueid isn't human.
I must still be half-asleep if I forgot something as
important as that.
<Page10>
"Well, be that as it may, it doesn't change the fact
that this is a good thing.
I'm glad your wound wasn't that big of a deal after
all."
"Oh, what's the matter, Shiki? It wasn't that long ago
that you were calling me a monster."
<Page11>
"Oh come on... I still feel that way, but the situation
has changed. It's only natural that I'd feel grateful
to my savior."
<Page12>
"Savior? You mean me?"
<Page13>
Arcueid's eyes open wide in surprise.
By the looks of it, it seems like she doesn't consider
it praiseworthy.
<Page14>
"That's right. You're the one who saved me.
So, I know it's a bit late, but... thank you for
protecting me. If you hadn't pulled me out of the way,
I'd have burned to death as well."
<Page15>
"'Thank you', you say―――it's fine, you don't have to
go that far. Besides, I was the reason that you and
Vlov met in the first place. I don't deserve that kind
of gratitude."
<Page16>
"But, it's also true that you saved me. You were the
one who acted as my shield. That alone is more than
enough reason to thank you."
<Page17>
"I guess it's true when you look at it that way...
But I've still got to disagree, Shiki. If I hadn't made
you watch over me, you never would've had to go through
all that.
I'm the one that took away your normal life. Wouldn't
it be more appropriate to hate me than feel gratitude
toward me?"
<Page18>
She sure gets fixated on the weirdest things.
Come on. Gratitude isn't something that can be
explained with logic and reason; it's a matter of
feeling.
<Page19>
"I'm not wrong.
I have to take responsibility for my own actions.
Someone taught me that lesson long ago.
She told me that no matter what anyone around me
thinks, I have to take that which I hold dear into my
own hands."
<Page20>
That's why I don't feel any resentment or malice toward
Arcueid for making me her guard.
At most, I would probably blame myself for getting
caught up in this mess.
<Page21>
"―――I see. Now that you mention it, the reason that
I needed a shield in the first place was because you
went and killed me.
So are you saying that there's no need for me to
apologize for getting you involved?"
<Page22>
"Yeah, that's exactly it. I'm just getting what I
deserve, that's all."
<Page23>
"Getting what you deserve, huh.
Yeah, you've had bad luck from the get-go, haven't you?
If you'd picked anyone other than me as your murder
victim, you probably never would have ended up in this
mess."
<Page24>
"Hey now..."
To begin with, the assumption that I would kill someone
other than her is absurd.
<Page25>
Getting such an urge, walking around aimlessly, and
eventually killing someone... The only time that has
ever happened was with Arcueid.
Rather, I don't think there's anyone other than her
that I'd even want to―――
<Page26>
"―――Ah."
"What? Did you remember something just now?"
"No, it's not that I forgot something or anything like
that... Come to think of it, why did I even want to
kill you in the first place...?"
<Page27>
Arcueid looks at me, furrowing her brow.
A natural reaction.
After all, I, the perpetrator, just said I don't know
why I killed her.
<Page28>
"I mean, it's not like you needed a reason, right?
Because you're a murderer at heart, after all."
"――――――Huh?"
<Page29>
Hold on.
What did she just say to me―――?
<Page30>
"You seemed very practiced back then when you attacked
me.
You pressed the bell, thrust your hand out the moment
the door opened, and then forcibly made your way
inside.
Then while I was still in shock, you halted my vital
activity with your first attack, then tore my body to
pieces."
<Page31>
"Yeah, that surprise attack was absolutely flawless.
If you were to ask me how perfect it was, I'd say it
was so perfect that if you had captured that moment on
canvas, it would've become a work of art unmatched by
any other.
If I were still at full power, I would've taken you
back to my castle as a souvenir."
<Page32>
With a rather captivated voice, she utters something
bizarre.
But, no, that's...
<Page33>
"Tha―――"
<Page34>
"But this time, you killed the wrong person.
I don't know how many people you've killed so far, but
I think when you selected me as your prey, it meant it
was finally time for you to pay the piper."
<Page35>
"Th-Th-That's..."
<Page36>
"What do you mean by 'Th-Th-That's'? And what's with
the scary look on your face?
If you have something to say, then say it. After all
we've been through, there's no need to hold back,
right?"
<Page37>
She's right.
After I nod, I gently beckon her over.
<Page38>
"What is it? Are you gonna tell me a secret?"
<Page39>
Arcueid comes over to me, brimming with excitement and
anticipation.
I bring my mouth close to her ear so that I can clearly
get my point across.
<Page40>
"...You know, Arcueid."
"Yeah, what's up?"
Here I go―――
<Page41>
"IT'S NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL, YOU STUPID WOMAN―――!"
<Page42>
You stupid woman-, oman-, n-......
My all-out scream echoes around the room.
I mercilessly assault Arcueid's eardrums with as much
volume as I can muster.
<Page43>
"........."
Arcueid covers her ears exaggeratedly.
<Page44>
"Geez, how dare you! What do you think you're doing,
Shiki!"
<Page45>
"I'm the one who should be angry!
I knew something was off when you gave me such an
absurdly difficult order, but now I finally get it!"
"Huh...? What do you mean 'get it'...?"
<Page46>
"You ordered me to shield you from that monster,
thinking that I was some kind of crazy murderer!
Oh come on, this is a huge misunderstanding!
Listen up, I'm only going to say this once: I'm not a
serial killer or a homicidal maniac. When it comes to
people―――killing people, you were my first, okay?"
<Page47>
Arcueid's mouth hangs wide open.
It seems I've made her realize what she's put me
through up to this point.
<Page48>
"―――No way. With skills like those, you're telling
me that was your first time, Shiki...!?"
<Page49>
"That's right. I may have these strange eyes, but even
so, I've been trying my best to lead an honest life.
I've never thought about wanting to use these 'lines'
to kill a person even once."
<Page50>
"Hmm... If that's the case, why did you go and kill a
complete stranger like me?"
"―――Well, that's because..."
<Page51>
Just as I'm about to say that I don't know, I realize
just how despicable I am.
<Page52>
"At that moment, I...
The moment we crossed paths in the city, I was so
entranced that I felt like I would throw up."
All I could think of was that white figure―――
<Page53>
Without stopping my lust-sullied self―――
A vulgar smile plastered on my lips―――
<Page54>
"And so, in that state―――
The next thing I knew, with these hands, I―――"
<Page55>
In this very room.
For no reason, with no purpose.
I trampled all over that beautiful figure.
<Page56>
"―――――I see."
Strength drains from my body.
Losing my ability to stand, I fall to my knees.
<Page57>
Ah, that's right... I had no right to be mad at
Arcueid.
Even though she survived. Even though she isn't human.
The reality of the situation remains: I killed her with
my very own hands.
<Page58>
"Come on, why have you gone all quiet again?
What do you even mean by 'I see', Shiki?"
"I'm saying... that I have to say... I'm sorry..."
<Page59>
Caught up in this incredibly abnormal situation, I
forgot something very important.
I was so scared that I turned away from the thing I
should've done before anything else.
<Page60>
"―――I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Arcueid.
I killed you, here in this room. Even though I should
have apologized to you before anything else―――"
<Page61>
It's no wonder that Arcueid thought that I was a
murderer.
I brazenly acted like a victim after doing all that
without any confession or remorse.
Not only that, but I still don't even understand the
impulse I had at that time―――
<Page62>
"The truth is that I killed you.
That's why... I have to be punished. A killer like me
must not be allowed to blend in with the rest of
society."
<Page63>
I'm such a coward. Only voicing the truth now, when
it's much too late.
Someone who kills for no reason should've never had a
place in society to begin with.
<Page64>
"―――I see.
You really don't understand why you did it, do you?"
I nod while hanging my head in shame.
<Page65>
"In other words, you didn't enjoy doing it, right?
Yeah... It's true that there are serial killers out
there that kill people as naturally as breathing, but
you seem to be a very honest guy at heart."
"I guess so... That was what I was trying to say, more
or less."
<Page66>
"No, you're so honest that you're almost  honest,
Shiki.
So, was I really the only one you've ever wanted to
kill?"
"Yeah... I've never felt that way about anyone else but
you."
<Page67>
"Well then, in that case there's no problem.
Come on, lift your head, Shiki. You're not some
bloodthirsty killer."
"......"
<Page68>
I raise my head as if I'd been granted forgiveness.
In front of me, I see the confident smile of someone
who looked past the act of me killing her. A smile that
believed in me more than I believed in myself.
<Page69>
"Besides, there's no need for you to be punished.
It just so happened that the person that you wanted to
kill was me. And to make matters worse, you possess an
unparalleled aptitude for murder."
<Page70>
"But fortunately for you, I happen to be a vampire, so
no one died in the end, right?
That's why there's no reason for you to suffer. I don't
think you have to worry about the ethics of human
society either."
<Page71>
"Humans don't have the right to judge you. After all,
the only ones in the world who can criticize you are
me, the victim, and you, the assailant."
<Page72>
"―――I get what you're trying to say. But that still
doesn't change the fact that I killed you, does it?"
<Page73>
That's right.
Even if these abnormal circumstances lead to me going
unpunished―――
My sin shall still remain for all eternity.
<Page74>
"Of course not. It's not like I've completely forgiven
you either. It'd be troubling if you moved on so
quickly.
But you know what, Shiki? As long as you earnestly feel
remorse and continue to regret it, then there's no
problem, right?"
―――That's just sophistry.
<Page75>
"Shiki. Even among humans, there are people who will
never sell their soul to the devil no matter how much
they despise the world. For example, there are honest
people who can say that they're sorry, even to a
vampire.
That's why it's okay. No matter what anyone says, or
even if you yourself want to say otherwise―――You can
still belong to that side of the world."
<Page76>
"―――――"
I'm speechless...
The nerve of this woman―――How could she say such a
thing to her killer with a smile on her face?
<Page77>
"Look, that aside, don't we have a bigger problem on
our hands? Now that you're awake, we should talk about
what we're going to# do――#"
<Page78>
"!?"
It happened so suddenly.
Without any warning, Arcueid collapses to the floor
with a smile still on her face.
<Page79>
"Arcueid!?"
I rush over to her fallen body.
<Page80>
"Well, this is awkward... Perhaps I was too hasty after
all."
Arcueid takes a pained breath as sweat forms on her
forehead.
For a moment, I thought I saw a faint red color seeping
through her shirt...
<Page81>
"Arcueid, your wound―――"
The one she got when she protected me at the
hotel―――
<Page82>
"That's where Vlov got me, right? It's taking a while
to heal because of what you did to me.
I closed up the wound for now, but it seems that wasn't
very effective."
<Page83>
Arcueid's tone is cheerful.
However, I finally come to realize that there was a
faint sign of pain in her expression.
<Page84>
"You closed up the wound? With what...?"
"Ummm, that."
<Page85>
Arcueid points to an object lying on the wooden floor.
A brown object. At first glance, it looks a bit like a
baumkuchen, but on closer inspection, it's a roll of
100-yen duct tape.
<Page86>
"S-Stop being an idiot and get some rest!!!!
What kind of moron uses duct tape to close a
wound...!?"
<Page87>
"Geez, it's not nice to be calling people idiots all
the time.
If you keep doing that, I might actually end up
believing it myself."
"Be quiet. Now show me your wound...!"
<Page88>
I reach out for her white clothes.
However―――
Arcueid rolls over on the bed with a flop.
<Page89>
"Don't be ridiculous, what are you going to do if that
wound opens again?!"
"It's fine, just leave it be.
You should stop acting stupid as well. Trying to strip
a girl of her clothes makes you worse than a Dead
Apostle!"
<Page90>
"―――Hey now. I don't even see you as a human being,
so stuff like male or female is irrelevant.
Come on, just be quiet and stay still. If you die from
this wound after protecting me, I'll regret it for the
rest of my life."
<Page91>
Arcueid glares at me in dissatisfaction, and just as I
was wondering whether she would roll back toward me...
<Page92>
"........."
She stands up reluctantly, stubbornly refusing to talk.
It seems she's a bit sulky, but I guess I'm allowed to
look at the wound now.
<Page93>
"Alright... Let's take a look at what kind of treatment
you used."
"......"
Arcueid rolls up her clothes and exposes her abdomen.
<Page94>
"You――――――"
I desperately hold back the urge to yell at her.
She didn't just cover the wound in duct tape, she
wrapped so much of it around herself that it covers her
entire abdomen.
<Page95>
I put her clothes back on and pick her up.
<Page96>
"Hey――what do you think you're doing, Shiki?"
"Making you sleep on the bed. As much as I want to take
you to the hospital, we both know there's no way I can
do that."
And so, I place her down on the bed as gently as I can.
<Page97>
"Listen, until I come back, you are not allowed to move
around, you hear me?
If you walk around like you did earlier, I'll run off
and forget all about you, okay!?"
<Page98>
I look around the room.
As I thought... There's no first aid kit or anything
that I could use to treat her wound. She  someone
that can just come back to life after all.
This may well be the first time that this kind of thing
has ever happened to her.
The cash I have on me comes to a grand total of...
2,000 yen...
<Page99>
"No... this is no time to be caring about pride.
Arcueid. You said that you were rich, right?"
"Y-Yeah. It's not like I live in discomfort or
anything, why?"
<Page100>
"Cash, credit card, whatever you have, just lend it to
me. I'm going to go buy some first aid.
I don't know whether it will have any effect on you,
but I'll try to give you some basic medical care."
<Page101>
"That's fine, but it might not make a difference, you
know."
"I'll do it even if it won't. I can't just leave you
here like this."
<Page102>
"Got it. Maybe there's some meaning behind our bodies
having the same structure after all."
<Page103>
'Here', says Arcueid as she hands over a few 10,000 yen
bills.
Not that it really matters, but... did she just pull
that stack of cash out of thin air?
<Page104>
"You should just lie down and stay quiet. Ah, but you
can't fall asleep. Make sure that you stay awake even
when you're lying down."
"... Shiki, you're asking for something extremely
unreasonable."
<Page105>
"It's unreasonable, but do it anyway. Your bodily
functions decrease when you go to sleep. Same goes for
your immune system.
If you fall asleep with an open wound, it will just
keep getting worse and worse.
Sleeping will only help you recover from fatigue, it
won't heal wounds or illness. It's better for you to
stay awake for now until I can patch you up."
<Page106>
"―――Hmm. Yeah, that sounds about right."
Arcueid smiles happily.
As always, I have no idea what goes on inside her
head...
<Page107>
"Hey now... What exactly are you so happy about?"
"I'm happy because I can finally count on you."
<Page108>
"......"
I'm gonna go crazy.
I hold myself back from replying and focus on what I
need to do next.
For starters, I'll leave the room, take off my
blood-stained jacket,# and go shopping―――
<Page109>
However...
As I'm about to leave, I notice something in the
kitchen.
<Page110>
"―――It's food."
On the table sat something that would be more
accurately described as 'food' than 'a meal'. Actually,
it was less like food and more like just ingredients.
Upon further consideration, even that might be a
generous description.
So this was the reason why Arcueid was in the kitchen
earlier.
<Page111>
Arcueid said that she doesn't eat ordinary meals.
It goes without saying who this was prepared for.
<Page112>
"Oh come on―――what the hell is wrong with her?"
I'm getting irritated.
So irritated that I waste no time dashing out to buy
something I can use to give her first aid.
