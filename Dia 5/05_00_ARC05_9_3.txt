It has to be towing.
That's the only way. A brilliant idea if I do say so
myself.
Yes, if we can't get to him, then we'll have him come
to us.
<Page2>
It'd be impossible for me to do alone, but if Arcueid
still has enough power left, we might be able to swing
it...!
<Page3>
I run back toward Arcueid.
"Shiki―――!"
I hear the sound of ice being smashed behind me.
The claw-shaped pressure wave she sent out seems to be
accurate not just within her reach, but even at this
distance.
<Page4>
"Why the hell did you come over here, Shiki?
And why do you have such a proud look on your face?!"
"I'll explain later, so just do that thing!
The ivy you caught Vlov with earlier!"
<Page5>
There's no time to spare.
I shout and gesture my intention to tie Vlov up with
the ivy.
<Page6>
"From this distance?!# Ah, that was close...!"
"I need you to somehow use it as a lasso!"
"Huh?! Geez, I don't get it, but I just have to catch
him right?!"
<Page7>
My desperation must have come across since, despite her
apparent bewilderment, Arcueid raises her hand toward
Vlov and―――
<Page8>
"That's it! You're amazing, Arcueid!"
". But what do we do now?"
<Page9>
"That's obvious―――pull as hard as you can!"
"As hard as I can? Like this?!"
<Page10>
Given how forcefully Arcueid can throw debris around,
she should be able to reel in Vlov at high speed.
This'll be much more efficient than if I were to run.
<Page11>
The question is to what extent Vlov has the power to
stand his ground.
There's no way he'd let go of his distance advantage.
He will definitely resist Arcueid's pull with all he's
got.
<Page12>
This is a tug of war between two vampires.
The weaker one will be pulled into the other's
position―――
<Page13>
"―――Huh?"
It happens in an instant. The black cloak, fifty meters
away, vanishes.
Faster than we can prepare ourselves, the enemy we came
to defeat appears before our eyes.
<Page14>
We've lost our buffer of safety.
It's not that Vlov didn't  to approach us. He, like
me, just didn't have the strength to do so.
And in spite of that, I gave him a tailwind.
<Page15>
"―――Ah."
A massive foreign object pierces my chest.
I take a deep breath for the last time.
<Page16>
"―――Are you not aware of the basics of hunting?
The rope should be secured... only after killing the
prey."
I hear the voice of a hunter, disappointed from the
bottom of his heart.
<Page17>
I blew it.
I leapt at such a hare-brained plan with no regard for
my own life.
A fitting end for an idiot no better than a stray dog.
