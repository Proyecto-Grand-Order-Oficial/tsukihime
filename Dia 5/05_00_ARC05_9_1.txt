<Page1>
It has to be throwing.
No, more accurately a bullet.
Even if his guard is up now, it doesn't change the fact
that I'm a lethal weapon to him.
<Page2>
Now it's just a matter of how to shoot me.
It's simple. If I can't get over there with my legs,
I'll have to rely on something else...!
<Page3>
I run back toward Arcueid.
"Shiki―――!"
I hear the sound of ice being smashed behind me.
The claw-shaped pressure wave she sent out seems to be
accurate not just within her reach, but even at this
distance.
<Page4>
"Geez, why did you come over here?! You've just turned
us into a single target!"
<Page5>
It's in Vlov's favor to have all of his prey grouped
up.
I know that too.
<Page6>
"I know, but this is the only way!
You tossed that debris just now, right?!
I need you to do the same thing to me!"
"Huh?!"
<Page7>
'Do the same thing  me' would be more accurate.
The debris from earlier was a chunk of floor that was
almost three meters long.
If she can throw something that large that fast, I can
get there way quicker than if I were to run!
<Page8>
"I kind of understand what you're trying to say!
But won't you get knocked away en route?!"
"Normally, yes! But you can send out as many of those
binding things as you want, right?!"
"―――Well... yeah I can."
<Page9>
Arcueid is hesitant, but right now we have no other
choice.
I'll get her to bind me onto a piece of rubble big
enough for me to hide behind, and have her throw it
toward Vlov.
Naturally, I would get shot down if I was aimed
directly at him.
So if possible, she should throw three pieces of
debris.
<Page10>
The first shot should be aimed directly at Vlov―――
The second shot should deliberately miss and land
behind him―――
And the third shot should be aimed at him again.
<Page11>
The second shot is the one I'll be hiding behind.
Just before it hits the ground, I'll cut the 'lines' on
the rubble to break it apart, and take Vlov from behind
in under two seconds...!
<Page12>
"Are you sure you wanna do that?
If we miss the timing, your corpse is gonna end up
smeared across the ground you know."
"That's only if we miss. If things go smoothly, we can
kill him without getting hurt. This is the only way."
<Page13>
The barrage of ice spears grows in intensity.
We can't waste any more time here.
<Page14>
"―――I got it. So while I'm aiming for Vlov, I need
to miss him with the one piece of debris that you're
riding on, right?"
"Yeah. Just throw it slightly to his side or
something."
<Page15>
I go around behind Arcueid.
I flatten myself against a large piece of debris. With
my body up against the rock's surface, I arrange myself
in a push-up position.
<Page16>
Green ivy emerges from Arcueid's fingertips and ties me
to the debris.
Both of my thighs and my left hand are pinned to it.
The only thing left free is my right hand holding the
knife.
<Page17>
"Based on the one I threw earlier...
I'd say it's about fifty meters to Vlov."
<Page18>
With two hands, Arcueid lifts up both a chunk of decoy
rubble and the piece of rubble that I'm hiding behind.
"Yeah, hold on for four seconds!!"
<Page19>
One ton of bedrock flies through the air.
Three seconds later.
As though overwhelming the attempts of air resistance
to slow it down through sheer power, the first throw
hurtles toward Vlov's head―――
And just before impact, is shattered by the ice lance.
<Page20>
However, it's not as though it was in vain.
Though the rubble was shattered, some fraction of the
splintered fragments score direct hits on Vlov's body.
Despite not dealing any damage, they at least chip away
at his focus.
<Page21>
In that opening, the debris carrying me passes right by
him.
<Page22>
I dismantle the debris.
Inertia comes to a stop.
My limbs are freed.
I stick to the ground like a lizard.
My body temperature and blood freeze instantly.
<Page23>
"―――."
I can see Vlov's back.
Four meters. It'll be close, but it's not impossible.
<Page24>
Arcueid's third throw holds him in position.
One second passes. One meter to go.
In two more steps, I'll be able to reach his 'line' and
sever his life.
<Page25>
However.
Those two steps form a boundary that no human can
cross.
<Page26>
"――――――"
My ability to scream―――
And my capacity to feel pain are already frozen solid.
Did he notice me, or was it simply an autonomic
interception?
A countless number of ice thorns have sprouted around
Vlov to greet his would-be assailant.
<Page27>
"―――As the fool you are... you chose the path of
safety."
A voice of disappointment reaches me.
Safety. Safety. Safety, huh.
I was thinking about a way to save myself.
Out of concern for me, Arcueid had adjusted her throw
to be a second slower than the other ones.
This was a failure... This was beyond foolish of me.
This was nowhere close to a surprise attack.
<Page28>
There is no need to wait until I bleed to death.
The cold waves that afflicted Vlov, combined with my
own disappointment in myself, have brought my heart to
a complete stop.
