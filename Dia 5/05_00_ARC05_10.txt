"I'm... exhausted."
I roll over onto my back.
My heart and lungs scream with relief.
My breathing, which had been stopped for so long,
finally resumes.
<Page2>
My hands can no longer move.
I'm not even sure if I'm still holding the knife.
The only things I can be sure of are the pain all over
my body, and the fact that as soon as the tension was
released, my consciousness began to sink into the
darkness.
<Page3>
...I really am fortunate. My sense of pain has been
numbed as a result.
The pain in my left foot, which I broke midair, would
have been unbearable otherwise. It's as if every bone
in my body is being hacked off. I can't even feel the
pain that had me seeing sparks before.
<Page4>
"But―――shit."
I don't mean to let the swear slip, but I can't help
it.
<Page5>
...I don't feel anything at having survived.
And I'm not left with any pride after having
accomplished such a feat.
I can't even call it a miracle. Now that the dust has
settled, all I can do is slap my feelings together.
<Page6>
"―――――The moon."
There is a waning moon in the night sky.
...I wonder why.
It's terribly familiar. I feel like I saw something
similar in my dreams at least once.
<Page7>
"Are you okay, Shiki?"
<Page8>
Arcueid wanders up to me as if nothing had happened.
<Page9>
"―――Well, I'm alive, at least."
To be honest, it feels like I'm dying. Even speaking is
painful.
But as someone who managed to make it out alive, it'd
be unforgivable to whine about it.
<Page10>
"Geez, you really don't need to be so humble.
The one you killed may have been  , but it
was still one of the Ancestors, you know?
You should be more proud of yourself."
<Page11>
Arcueid's chest is puffed out with something like
vicarious pride.
Speaking practically, there must have been  value
in having killed Vlov. Even I know that much...
But even so―――
<Page12>
...There was nothing I could do.
How far did that glacier encroach on the city? At the
very least, the carnage was even worse than at the
hotel. And yet, again I turn a blind eye―――
"Huh? They're not dead, you know.
If you're worried about Vlov's curse, I've got it all
covered."
―――Or so I thought.
<Page13>
"W-What do you mean by that, ...!!"
As soon as I strain myself to sit up, I feel a sharp
pain in my left leg that sends me sprawling.
<Page14>
"Come on now, you need to lie down."
"...! M-More importantly than that, I need you... to
explain everything.
Are they really not dead...?"
<Page15>
"Yeah. When Vlov's Principle went out of control, I
coated everything I could with a convective membrane.
If you had killed him even a little bit later, I
wouldn't have been able to keep it up."
<Page16>
Arcueid readily confesses her outrageous offense.
...Speaking of which, at that moment.
She made a strange, sudden stop before being hit by
Vlov's lance.
Was that not to protect herself, but rather to protect
the city...?
<Page17>
...Yeah, that's right. If you think about it, it's
strange that I'm still alive even after that cold wave
had spread out.
Just as I was able to breathe in those super cold
temperatures, the people of the city must have also
been safe.
That's why―――
<Page18>
That's why she was in such a mess.
While I was only thinking of myself, she protected the
entire city, despite knowing that it would put her at a
disadvantage―――
<Page19>
"Y―――Why would you do something like that?!
Didn't you say that you don't care about humans?!"
In a fit of unidentifiable rage, I yell thoughtlessly
at the carefree figure in front of me.
Arcueid curiously raises and lowers her eyebrows, and
then...
<Page20>
"Well, that's because it's what you said you wanted."
She says something incredibly stupid.
<Page21>
"――――――"
...Did I, say that?
When? Where? Maybe it was...
<Page22>
"But you're kind of different. After all, you've never
even drunk blood before.
In that case, it's fine. Whether you're a vampire or
whatever else, as long as you don't lay a hand on any
of us, it's okay."
<Page23>
―――I don't believe this.
'If you don't lay a hand on any of us, it's okay.'
She did it because of ?
Even when she could have been destroyed with one wrong
move?
<Page24>
"..."
I laugh at the absurdity of it.
I'm even more stunned than I was before.
I'm stunned, but more than that, I'm more grateful than
I've ever been.
<Page25>
...I close my eyes.
With this, I think I can go to sleep now.
My chest, which until just now had been filled with
nothing but regret, is now swathed in relief.
My consciousness fades away.
I forget the pain in my legs and fall into a deep
sleep.
And then...
<Page26>
Arcueid bonking me on the head forces me back to
reality.
"...What... are you trying to pull?"
<Page27>
"You can't. If you fall asleep with a wound like that,
it will be all the more painful when you wake up,
right? You should close your wounds before you go to
sleep. That'd be more efficient, you know?"
<Page28>
―――I'll be damned if that's not a sound argument.
I wonder who told her that?
<Page29>
"...Arcueid. Can I give you some serious advice?"
"Hmm, what is it?"
"You know. You should stop saying such absurd things,
you stupid woman."
<Page30>
That's my limit.
With that, I've really used up all my energy.
<Page31>
My consciousness fades.
Arcueid is making a fuss about something, but I don't
have the strength to open my eyes anymore.
<Page32>
"Ah... hold on, Shiki, are you really gonna fall
asleep...?"
...I already told you I was sleepy.
I'm falling asleep, not dying. I'll be sure to wake up
when morning comes.
<Page33>
"Are you really sure you wanna do that? It's definitely
gonna hurt. Do you really not need any healing? You're
gonna faint when you wake up, you know?"
―――Oh, shut up.
I'm going to sleep. If you want to do something then
just do it.
<Page34>
"Huh...? If that's the case then you should've told me
that earlier!"
After hearing that cheerful voice.
I feel cold fingertips, colder than my frozen body,
touch my skin in a caring manner.
At the pleasant sensation, an expression of joy
overtakes my drowsy countenance.
<Page35>
"Spoils of war? Or rather, the Ancestor's remains?
Well, whatever! I was worried about where to throw it
away anyway!"
...Slime?
<Page36>
"W-W-What, what was that feeling? Did you apply
something just now?!
  , the pain is coming back!?
It hurts a lot, no, it's itchy, or rather, it's scary!
What the hell are you―――"
<Page37>
Right as I was about to ask what she was doing, I was
struck by a tremendous feeling of despondency.
<Page38>
Was that shouting just now the last remaining heat in
my body?
This time, my consciousness goes into a deep sleep
without fighting back.
<Page39>
"It's okay, this stuff isn't bad. I'm just using it to
plug up where your flesh has been gouged.
But I can't do much about the bones. You should
definitely see a human doctor later."
The cold fingertips withdraw.
<Page40>
"Did you fall asleep, Shiki―――?"
―――Yeah, I really am asleep.
It's been a while since I've had such a deep
sleep―――a sleep that wasn't so dreadful.
<Page41>
"Well, no surprise there. Your house is the mansion on
top of that hill, right?
I'll find a way to bring you home somehow."
―――I simply gaze fixedly at the white moon as I
sleep.
<Page42>
"...You've done well, Shiki. And thank you.
I was saved tonight thanks to you."
<Page43>
Words of gratitude that didn't seem to carry any weight
in the slightest.
I can't hear her voice any longer.
This time, undisturbed by anyone, I fall into a deep
sleep.
