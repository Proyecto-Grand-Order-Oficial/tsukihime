<Page1>
His chest is pierced.
A great deal of blood is spilled.
The plug that held in Vlov's blood has been removed.
<Page2>
The burning <delusion|d r e a m    > comes to an end.
The final boundary is crossed.
And then―――
with an earth-rending scream, the vampire's true form
is revealed.
<Page3>
The atmosphere creaks.
The frenetic dance of atoms is abruptly brought to a
crawl.
Electrons, repelled by the solidified rift of
near-absolute zero temperatures, have nowhere to go and
start to react.
<Page4>
The blue flames that blanketed the ground were not
flames at all.
Similar to the enthalpy of vaporization, they were more
like heat that had been lost from the earth itself.
<Page5>
"―――Ah, it's true."
A cold-blooded arm hangs in the air.
The palm of his hand is outstretched, as if groping for
warmth.
<Page6>
"―――This <place|w o r l d   > is cold."
The white beauty in front of him is swallowed
completely.
<Page7>
"――――――Huh?"
This isn't just a drop in temperature. It's as if the
world itself suddenly changed without warning.
<Page8>
The river of ice that sprung forth from Vlov didn't
just blow away Arcueid, it kept extending all the way
to the city behind her.
<Page9>
It can't have taken more than two seconds.
The glacier reached the buildings on the surface and
froze everything in an instant.
What if...
What if there were still people in those buildings who
hadn't evacuated. Any warmth they might've had has been
snatched away.
<Page10>
My body trembles at the unbelievable scene in front of
me.
I'm terrified at the prospect of what might happen
next.
It's only by  that I'm still alive.
If I had been behind Arcueid, I would've been frozen
where I stood.
<Page11>
The expanding river of flames was a slow-moving
disaster.
People were able to run away faster than the fire was
able to spread.
But that glacier formed in an instant.
Its range is narrow, and the cold wave only crawls
along the ground, but once it's released there would be
no hope of escaping it.
<Page12>
If that guy manages to get above ground, anyone that
comes face to face with him would have no choice but to
lay down and die.
<Page13>
"―――Arcueid.
That's right, where's Arcueid...!?"
<Page14>
I hang on to my one and only hope.
She's the only one who can stop that monster.
<Page15>
"There she is...!"
In the middle of the icy river stands the figure of
Arcueid.
Thank goodness... That girl really is tough as well.
She's standing amidst that frigid air without a scratch
on her...!
<Page16>
"So that's how it is...
You haven't lost your sanity, you're just running away
from it."
<Page17>
"Even third-rate Dead Apostles are able to overthrow
the planet if they possess a Principle, huh?
Thanks to that, I'm wide awake now, Vlov Arkhangel."
<Page18>
Arcueid brushes off the glacier.
Vlov stares at her with cold eyes.
Not with the sickly eyes from before, but with eyes
that carefully observe their prey like a hunter in a
snowfield.
<Page19>
"I'm the one who should say such things.
How dare you rob so much warmth from me."
<Page20>
His voice is like a blade, his words dripping with
hatred.
The vampire's fighting spirit has not faded.
No...
To be more precise, it's like he's actually ready to
fight for the first time.
<Page21>
"I see. Then accept your good fortune, Vlov. Normally,
I would have finished you before you woke up, but
thanks to a despicable murderer, your life has been
spared. Well, for a short time at least."
<Page22>
"―――Indeed.
You're quite different in person from what I had been
led to expect.
It appears that in this moment of truth, fortune smiles
upon me."
<Page23>
"I hate to say it, but you're right.
It seems that both of us only have one final attack
remaining. Whichever of us attacks, the other will
disappear.
But before that, allow me to extend to you at least
this courtesy."
<Page24>

<Page25>
It was a stern voice, jarringly out of place in the
current situation.
Arcueid's question could be taken as a reprimand.
After opening his eyes wide in surprise, Vlov replies.
<Page26>
"―――     

He reveals his own true self, with a voice that could
be construed as almost respectful.
<Page27>
"I remember now...
There was an outsider who so despised and feared humans
that in order to avoid them, she set herself adrift
among the distant oceans, holding there a castle.
One of the Twenty-Seven Ancestors: Zaria Offenbaum.
I heard she'd been in possession of a Principle that
had persisted for over a thousand years, yet had not
sired a single offspring during her reign... .
So basically,        ,
didn't you?"
<Page28>
"That's right... I am no Successor... I am simply a
knight――― a knight... Eternity is something well
beyond my station."
<Page29>
The vampire turns his right hand toward his own shadow.
From the long――unnaturally long――shadow that
stretches before him emerges the hulking form of an
 weapon.
<Page30>
"However... my liege was not suited to it either.
As such, I stole it. The Knight defeated the Queen...
claiming the throne for himself... Now... this
Principle is a curse I bear alone."
"I see. It must have been a short reign."
<Page31>
"Still standing firm...? Though you have weakened so
much that you cannot even deploy your 
... you still intend to face me head-on?"
"I don't need it. It is not necessary for me to
synchronize with the world just to take out a mere Dead
Apostle.
For someone of your stature, my claws will prove more
than enough."
"――――――"
<Page32>
The edges of the vampire's mouth twist upwards.
His refined face warps into that of an ugly beast.
It's as though he's grinning in agreement with
Arcueid's provocation.
<Page33>
"Those that are strong... are those that through
vicissitudes remain unfaltering.
And that is truly what you are... Though your power may
be diminished... it is above mine nonetheless.
One who can with all curses deal; through all
situations adapt:   ... An ordinary Dead
Apostle stands no chance..."
<Page34>
The air distorts.
The blue flames born from sickened thoughts begin to
drop the temperature in the crater.
<Page35>
Arcueid doesn't hesitate.
She charges Vlov head-on, despite knowing that his
strange weapon has the potential to defeat her.
And then―――
<Page36>
"Yet you do not know...
Although this domain is part of the planet, all the
same, it is a biosphere foreclosed, in which none can
live...
Though you may be the Princess of the True Ancestors...
do not think you can endure this hell...!"
<Page37>
A wave of cold air billows out around Vlov.
Arcueid comes to a sudden halt and sticks her hands out
in a protective gesture.
The wind blows fiercely, and with a piercing howl
envelops the city in absolute zero.
And then―――
<Page38>
A huge lance of otherworldly steel pulverizes her pure
white dress.
<Page39>
The blizzard blocks my sight...
My breath comes out white.
<Page40>
Arcueid is blown dozens of meters back and collapses on
top of the wreckage.
The dress that had been repelling the flames is
shattered.
She reverts to her former self.
<Page41>
"You monster... Even in suffering the blow of my lance,
do you retain your form.
Nevertheless―――"
<Page42>
Arcueid stays down, showing no signs of waking.
Without moving from where he stands, Vlov holds up his
right hand as if to signal something.
The rubble around him crumbles.
Several corpses crawl out from underground, groaning.
<Page43>
"The spoils of this hunt now belong to me.
Go forth and pick up that woman's corpse.
That adaptability. That all-powerful blood which
transcends all anguish, bring it to me."
<Page44>
At Vlov's command, the corpses begin walking over to
Arcueid.
<Page45>
The winner has been decided.
Our strategy has failed.
Vlov cannot be sealed by those chains anymore.
Arcueid has been defeated, and the city engulfed by a
freezing wave.
Everything around me has been annihilated.
I stand right in front of it all, watching the final
scene unfold before my eyes―――
