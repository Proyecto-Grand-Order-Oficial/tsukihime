The city is in a frenzied panic.
I run through the crowded streets.
Even from here, I can see the fire coming from the
front of the station.
<Page2>
The screens outside broadcast the breaking news on
repeat.
A fire has broken out in the vicinity of Souya
Station's north gate.
The trains have been suspended, and the people who were
visiting the downtown area are frantically running for
their lives.
<Page3>
A news anchor covering the emergency is on the screens.
It's an interview with a high school girl who has just
escaped from the fire.
"It's hot, it's hot. Hey, why is it so hot?
My friend――Yuka――she was eaten by them. They even
got my arm. It's like...
They're moving even though they're dead! They're
laughing even though they're burning...!"
Her words were treated as shock-induced delusions.
<Page4>
The fire is spreading even now, to the point where
nearby residents have been advised to evacuate.
Despite that, the main street is overflowing with
people.
Carried away by their curiosity, people have surrounded
the area from a distance, observing, filming, and
relaying the situation to their closest friends.
<Page5>
"...!"
The road to the station has already been blocked off.
Fire prevention...? No, there's no way they'd have
managed to get these up so quickly. Besides, there are
too many people around.
It's almost like they're guarding the exits, making
sure nothing can escape.
<Page6>
"Crap...!"
Either way, we can't get through.
"Shiki, over here."
She vigorously pulls my hand.
<Page7>
Without waiting for an answer, Arcueid slips away
through the crowd of people, dragging me along behind
her.
<Page8>
"H-Hang on a second!
Why did you drag me all the way here?!"
<Page9>
I shake my hand free.
As Arcueid looks up at the wall of the building, she
says―――
<Page10>
"Yeah. This'll do.
This is my first time flying with another person, but
it shouldn't be an issue if we're only going this
high."
"Huh?"
<Page11>
She moves without hesitation.
She grabs my arm as if she were pinning me down, and
then―――
<Page12>
"We're going to fly. Hold on tight, Shiki."
Wait, she just said something completely
outrageous―――!
<Page13>
"――"
<Page14>
"―――"
<Page15>
"―――――!?"
<Page16>
We're flying.
No, we're jumping.
<Page17>
Arcueid bounds from wall to wall up the face of the
opposing buildings. Before I even have time to blink,
we're on top of the building―――no, soaring across
the sky.
Of course, she did all of this while holding onto me.
<Page18>
"W-W-Wait a, ...!"
We're so high! I'm terrified! How many meters above
ground is this? That building must've been around forty
meters tall and we're above that!? Even a twenty-meter
drop-tower ride would make my heart beat out of my
chest, let alone this! Where the hell am I supposed to
put my feet?!
<Page19>
"Hmm? Shiki, if you don't keep your mouth shut, you'll
bite your tongue off."
<Page20>
Tilting her head in confusion at my screams, Arcueid
ramps up the brutal pace even further.
We leap from rooftop to rooftop, building to building,
like a rabbit hopping on the surface of the moon.
<Page21>
"  ―――!?"
I endure this surreal experience with gritted teeth.
Just as I'm starting to enjoy it, Arcueid finally stops
leaping.
<Page22>
We're on the rooftop of a skyscraper overlooking the
city.
We've landed in a hanging garden; one that was not
originally designed for humans to enter.
<Page23>
"Eeh―――you, w-what the hell was that about―――"
<Page24>
All the sudden ups and downs have played havoc with my
breathing.
My chest hurts. My fluctuating blood pressure strains
my heart.
Although there hasn't been any change in air pressure,
my entire body has frozen up from all the shocks to my
system.
<Page25>
"Look. Over there."
"What do you mean, look ther―――"
<Page26>
I stop right before I finish my sentence.
In an instant, I forget all about the pain caused by my
elevated heart rate.
<Page27>
―――It's burning.
The city I live in, the familiar buildings, are all
being consumed by the sea of flames.
"What――――――"
I now see the full extent of the horror.
<Page28>
The main street is wrapped in a red veil.
Little by little, the fire continues to burn away the
buildings' silhouettes, as if whittling them down with
a blade.
<Page29>
This is truly a river of fire. Within it is a man
ceaselessly devouring. He bathes himself in the crimson
rain, slaking his thirst.
There are several people in front of the man.
They're the police officers who were setting up the
barricade.
The officers raise their pistols and fire in unison.
<Page30>
"―――Wha―――"
However, he doesn't even flinch.
He likely doesn't even notice their presence.
More figures appear from behind the monster――from
behind Vlov.
<Page31>
Burning Corpses.
They were probably living, breathing humans until just
a few minutes ago. But now, they've become moving
corpses.
As if they were begging for help―――
The corpses move toward the firing officers―――
<Page32>
"―――What the hell―――is this―――"
Emotionless words leak from my throat.
I didn't even have the chance to look away.
The sense of duty and urgency I had while running
toward the city have been wiped clean.
Right now, the only thing left in my mind is pure fear.
<Page33>
 is a vampire's true nature.
A being whose mere existence brings death.
And  is the enemy we must now defeat―――
<Page34>
"There's no sign of the people from the Church...
If they were really that intent on hunting vampires,
then they should already be here... Looks like no one's
been assigned to this country after all.
But that doesn't explain the unusually strict traffic
control... Perhaps the Executors they sent are just
some pencil-pushers rather than real agents."
<Page35>
Unlike me, Arcueid isn't looking at the river of fire.
Instead, she's focusing her attention on something
completely different.
<Page36>
"So, what's the plan, Shiki?
As you can see, this is Vlov's true nature. He's some
crazed mass murderer that's too far gone to even
attempt to track me down."
<Page37>
"If we leave him be, he'll eventually run out of blood
and weaken.
Given Vlov's Lifescale, this city will probably burn to
the ground before he gets weak enough for me to be able
to take him down alone.
Do you want to watch idly from the sidelines? Or―――"
<Page38>
She's asking if I'm willing to put my life on the line
to save others.
Although she already knows what I'm about to say,
Arcueid asks me to confirm it one last time.
And so, with all the determination I can muster, I
glare at her, my body shuddering.
<Page39>
"... Seems like there's no changing your mind, huh.
To think that you'd still be willing to fight even
after seeing all that. You're one to talk. You're just
as much of a monster as Vlov.
But what should we do?
I don't mind starting with things the way they are,
but..."
<Page40>
Starting with things the way they are...?
Is she saying she can move the battlefield... no, that
she can  it!?
<Page41>
"You mean to say you can do something about this
situation!?"
"Yes, if all goes well. I don't want to attract any
attention either."
"I beg you...! Please go in and fight him right
now...!"
<Page42>
"Understood. In that case, I'll drop them all
underground.
There seems to be some kind of hollow space
underneath."
<Page43>
Wait... She's going to drop them... underground?
No, there's no time to be asking questions.
Right now, we need to get them off the streets as fast
as possible...!
<Page44>
"But don't forget our promise. Make sure you follow
after me."
<Page45>
My mind just can't keep up with all these surprises
happening one after another.
What the hell―――
Leaving me behind, Arcueid leaps off from the rooftop
and into the void.
<Page46>
A white flower, dancing in the wind.
<Page47>
An air current catches her body as she throws herself
from the rooftop.
The chains of gravity release―――
The grounding anchors are raised―――
And what should have fallen, rises gently instead.
Like a sailing ship catching the wind, she gambols
through the night sky.
<Page48>
This is no cause for surprise.
That figure is an avatar of the planet itself.
All the fluctuations that occur on its surface belong
to her.
<Page49>
The blessings of nature that nurture life―――
The wrath of nature that crushes it.
Of course such a body would possess these rights.
<Page50>
"Okay―――"
The beautiful flower twirls around, as if to gaze up at
the moon.
She turns her attention from the cosmos to the ground.
The unraveled chains and the raised anchors strike the
surface of the Earth.
Below her is a tall, stone building scattering sparks
of fire.
"―――Here we go!"
<Page51>
The blossom in the night sky transforms into a falling
star.
The flower of the moon transforms itself into a
tempest, blowing away the blazing flames.
