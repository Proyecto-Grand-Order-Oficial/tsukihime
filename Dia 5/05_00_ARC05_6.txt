"――――――!"
As I leave the building, I find that the area ahead of
me has been reduced to rubble.
I crouch down and advance, stopping just short of the
rim of the crater.

The new crater is forty meters deep.
This area used to be a park.
But there's no trace of it anymore.
The rubble forms a slope leading down to the foot of
the pit.
Although it'd be impossible to climb up from the
bottom, descending should be possible even with legs
like mine.
With that said―――
C:> I should descend.
C:> I should observe the situation.
