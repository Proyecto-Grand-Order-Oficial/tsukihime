That being said, it's not like I've ever dealt with a
situation like this before.
The only first aid measures that come to mind are gauze
for covering her wound, antiseptic, bandages, and
painkillers.
That and nutrition. I'd better pick up something for
her to eat.
<Page2>
Fortunately, I have a ton of money.
Although I'm no expert, my amateur opinion is
definitely better than coming up empty-handed. You
never know what might be of help to her.
With that in mind, I buy everything that I can think
of.
<Page3>
"Hey wait, that tickles!"
"........."
<Page4>
Ignoring her laid-back voice, I apply the gauze as
delicately as I can.
The wound on her abdomen isn't that large.
<Page5>
No... A four-centimeter-deep horizontal gash would've
been fatal for any human, but according to
Arcueid―――
"A wound like this isn't a big deal!"
Or something like that.
<Page6>
Anyway, it seems like her internal organs will heal on
their own soon. It's so outlandish that I'm not even
going to bother questioning it.
The bleeding's stopped, and all that's left is to close
the wound. But from this point on, I doubt things are
going to play out as they would with a human.
<Page7>
It might be counterproductive for a wound this large,
but I put some antiseptic on it to prevent bacterial
infection.
I thought she'd go berserk from the stinging pain of
the antiseptic, but she isn't moving at all.
Rather―――
"Hmm? Did you do something just now?"
She doesn't seem very sensitive... no, rather she's
tough.
<Page8>
"Alright..."
I put some gauze on her wound and carefully wrap a
bandage around it.
", stop it, you're too good at this, Shiki!"
<Page9>
Arcueid lets out a cheerful laugh, seemingly amused by
something.
Even though she didn't react at all when I applied the
antiseptic, it seems like the bandage is tickling her.
<Page10>
"......"
I ignore her and fasten the bandage on with a pin. They
say wounds stop bleeding when you apply pressure, so I
give the bandage a final tug to pull it tight.
"―――. Hey, I'm deducting points for that,
Shiki."
<Page11>
"........."
. With this, I've done everything that I can do for
the time being.
Incidentally, I've closed the curtains again out of
concern for Arcueid.
<Page12>
"Well... it looks right, but who knows how much good
it'll do. How do you feel?
Can you move, Arcueid?"
<Page13>
"Yeah, I've got no problems moving around. My insides
are still pretty messed up though, so I'm not as agile
as I'd like to be."
<Page14>
"Oh? Well, you'll have to deal with that on your own.
My specialty is cutting. Healing is outside of my
jurisdiction."
I move away from Arcueid and sit down, leaning against
the wall.
<Page15>
"Thank you for your patience, you can go to sleep now.
You'll get better faster if you sleep and recover your
strength, right? I'll stand guard, so you can just be
quiet and go to sleep."
<Page16>
"No, my wounds won't recover even if I sleep. It's just
like you said, sleeping can only help you recover from
fatigue.
In my case, my strength recovers purely with the
passage of time. By nightfall, I'll have recovered
enough to move around normally."
<Page17>
Regardless of what she says, seeing her in pain isn't
good for my mental health.
<Page18>
"―――C'mon, just go to sleep already.
You look like you're in pain just from trying to keep a
conversation going."
"That may be true, but you're still awake.
It'd be a waste if I were to sleep right now."
<Page19>
Arcueid sits upright on the bed.
She's in full-on chatter mode.
"―――Geez."
Guess I've got no choice.
I've got some questions I need to ask her as well, so
I'll keep chatting with her for a bit longer.
<Page20>
"Arcueid. Can I ask you about what happened at the
hotel yesterday?"
"Sure... I guess I should've expected you'd wanna talk
about that after what happened to us."
<Page21>
"That guy yesterday... I believe he called himself
Vlov――what the hell is he?
I get that he's a vampire. I mean, he's got those
elaborate clothes on and all, so he looks way more
vampire-like than you at least."
<Page22>
Those blue flames... What on earth were they? They
swept through the corridor but they only actually
burned people.
<Page23>
". What do you mean he's more 'vampire-like' than
me?
Though... you're not wrong.
His body wasn't falling apart and his  was
fairly small-scale, too. He's the sort of 'orthodox'
vampire people imagine.
―――Well, as long as you don't consider that river of
flame, at least."
<Page24>
"Exactly... As I thought, that fire is pretty abnormal
even from your perspective, right? Is he stronger than
you?"
As soon as I say that, Arcueid lets out an exaggerated
sigh.
<Page25>
"Well, you see... Thanks to a certain  killing
me, I've dropped to a level where even going up against
a second-rate Dead Apostle like that would qualify as a
'fight'.
If you were to compare my Lifescale with Vlov's right
now, he would be slightly stronger."
<Page26>
"I-I see...
So if you were still in good health, you'd be able to
defeat him somehow, right?"
<Page27>
"What do you mean 'somehow'? It'd be a slaughter in
that case!
Geez... besides, who do you think is responsible for
this humiliating situation in the first place? At my
usual strength, I could crush that wannabe Ancestor
just by glaring at him."
<Page28>
Oops, I made her upset...
Still, I'm not interested in these 'what-if' scenarios
right now.
The real question I'm driving at is whether Arcueid can
defeat that vampire in her current state...
<Page29>
"I can't. Right now, Vlov's stronger than me.# In terms
of pure power, I've fallen below him. If I fought him
straight up, I'd just get killed."
"T-That's quite direct coming from you. You got so mad
at me earlier for asking, too."
<Page30>
"It's just a fact. The situation is crystal clear; no
point in hoping for the best or making predictions to
the contrary."
<Page31>
Hearing that I get a bit intimidated.
When it comes to fighting, Arcueid has a very tough and
thorough thought process.
Seeing her cool-headed nature at close range, it once
again strikes me―――perhaps a little late―――that
she really is a vampire.
