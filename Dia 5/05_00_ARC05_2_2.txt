"........."
...I already know that.
If I want to return to a normal life as a human being,
I should just run away.
I'm fine with that. It's the best choice I can make.
But―――
<Page2>
What about Arcueid?
<Page3>
No, this isn't about Arcueid, this is about me.
If I stay here――If I become involved with her――I'm
bound to run into him.
<Page4>
That guy is crazy.
But the fact that he's a vampire, or that he can summon
those flames, is nothing when compared to those
otherworldly eyes of his.
<Page5>
His emotions are dead.
Everything about him is cold.
I mean, he doesn't even care about the lives of other
<vampires|a l l i e s   >, let alone humans.
There's no way that I can face him again.
As someone who was nearly killed by him once before,
I'm all too aware of this fact.
<Page6>
―――I'll refuse.
I  to refuse.
I can't think of any way I could possibly handle an
opponent like him.
<Page7>
"―――Arcueid, I――――"
But... is this  the right decision?
Am I really going to abandon her?
It's my fault. Tohno Shiki is the reason that this
woman can't even move around properly. Can I really
just turn my back on her?
<Page8>
"――――I――――"
Am I going to run away?
Am I really going to run away from that ruthless
monster, after he mercilessly reduced all those people
to ashes like they were nothing?
Am I really going to turn a blind eye, save my own
skin, and live on without a shred of conscience?
<Page9>
"―――――――"
The lines of death that only I can see.
I was told by someone I hold dear that I was endowed
with these eyes for times of great necessity.
<Page10>
If that's true... then the answer is obvious.
I can't shake off my doubts and fears, and I don't know
to what extent I'll even be able to help.
But still―――even a person like me can say what I
 want to do.
<Page11>
"―――Shiki?"
"...Arcueid. I don't get what you're talking about.
It doesn't matter how much of a monster he is, or how
powerless I am―――my responsibility doesn't change.
At the end of the day, I let all those people die. I
don't want to see anyone else meet the same fate.
That's why... I can't just run away all by myself. Not
after all this."
<Page12>
I look up at the ceiling and take a deep breath.
My resolve strengthens as a result.
<Page13>
"―――I will defeat that vampire.# I believe this is my
responsibility as the sole survivor of that tragedy at
the hotel."
<Page14>
Though I'm replying to her, it's as if I'm trying to
convince myself of what I said.
Arcueid lets out a single, heavy sigh, seemingly in
self-reproach.
