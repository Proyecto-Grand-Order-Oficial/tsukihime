We head to the park just after nine o'clock in the
evening.
<Page2>
"This is very important, so maybe I should explain it
one more time.
Long-lived Dead Apostles have 'superpowers' that
weaponize their very existence.
In addition to the basic abilities of bloodsuckers,
these individuals can drink blood in order to gain
something similar to a 'special curse'."
<Page3>
"Vlov is a Dead Apostle who has reached that stage.
Defeating a Dead Apostle means overcoming their
superpower.
Humans don't stand a chance against Vlov without a
means to extinguish those flames. That's why you need
to keep clear of him until I go and break his curse."
<Page4>
The plan itself is quite simple.
Arcueid will stay here and lure Vlov out.
Apparently, vampires can pinpoint each other's
locations if they don't hide their biological
wavelengths... or something like that.
<Page5>
It seems like Vlov isn't hiding his wavelength.
I don't know if it's because he doesn't care, or if he
simply can't do it.
<Page6>
Either way, if Vlov starts to approach us, Arcueid will
be able to detect him before he gets here.
On the other hand, Arcueid normally suppresses her
wavelength, but she's now emitting it freely in order
to provoke Vlov.
<Page7>
In other words, it's just like a moth trap.
All we have to do is wait for the moth――Vlov――to be
lured in by the light that is Arcueid.
<Page8>
After that, the plan is the same as before.
I'll hide in the bushes and keep an eye on the fight
from a distance.
When Arcueid binds Vlov with her chains, I'll jump out
of the shadows―――
And cut his 'lines'.
<Page9>
Arcueid shows no signs of nervousness.
She's just blankly staring at the sky in boredom.
<Page10>
"........."
But the same can't be said for me.
My hand unconsciously grips the knife hidden in my
pocket.
<Page11>
...I know.
There are a few uncertainties in this strategy.
<Page12>
For one, there's the possibility that Vlov will notice
me hiding.
Although Arcueid said that the possibility of this
happening is extremely low, in the end, it's still not
zero.
If that happens, there's no guaranteeing my safety.
There's a risk that I'll end up helplessly burning to
death, just like the people in the hotel.
<Page13>
But that's okay.
That's a risk I'm willing to take.
However, the real problem here is the other
possibility.
The possibility that Arcueid will fail to restrain
Vlov. In other words, if Arcueid loses.
<Page14>
If that happens... it'll all be up to me.
Stopping Vlov and saving Arcueid; it'll all be riding
on this single knife.
<Page15>
That vampire...
Can I really oppose those cursed flames all by myself?
<Page16>
Just thinking about it makes my limbs tremble.
I'm gripping my knife so hard that it's making my
fingers hurt.
An indescribable fear...
I myself don't even know what's causing this
feeling―――
<Page17>
"Are you scared, Shiki?"
When I snap out of my thoughts, Arcueid is standing
right in front of me.
How pathetic... She must've noticed that I was
trembling.
<Page18>
"Yeah, I'm scared shitless. Just the thought of that
vampire getting any closer makes me want to cry."
"Huh? But Shiki, you aren't crying?"
"That's because I'm holding it in. Try to understand,
idiot."
<Page19>
She really is insensitive. It'd be nice if she could
understand me, even if just a little.
<Page20>
"........."
However.
I'm not sure what part of what I just said got on her
nerves, but it seems like she's upset.
<Page21>
"In case you didn't know, I'm also a vampire, just like
him."
"Yeah, I know. You've only told me a million times."
<Page22>
"Like I said, I'm also a vampire. Shouldn't you be
afraid of me as well?
Based on what you've said so far, I'd have expected you
to think of me as a disgusting monster."
"Huh?"
<Page23>
Now that she's pointing it out, I'm a bit surprised.
She's absolutely right... but...
<Page24>
"But you're kind of different. After all, you've never
even drunk blood before, so it's okay. Whether you're a
vampire or whatever else, as long as you don't lay a
hand on any of us, it's okay."
<Page25>
"I see. That's one way of thinking about it."
I don't know if she understood or not, but she makes a
noncommittal sound and drops the topic.
<Page26>
The hands of the clock point toward ten.
According to Arcueid, this is when vampires are most
active.
<Page27>
Vlov will show himself on the surface...
I don't know where his stronghold is, but I'm sure that
once he wakes up, he'll sense Arcueid's presence and
come to us.
<Page28>
"――――――Has he lost his mind?"
Arcueid's tone changes.
With a mutter of intense disgust, she glares
north――in the direction of the station.
<Page29>
"Arcueid...?"
"I can't believe it―――is he  one of the
Ancestors?"
<Page30>
I turn to follow Arcueid's gaze.
Is that... smoke?
There's a pillar of smoke rising on the horizon.
There must be a fire somewhe―――no, hold on.
A ...!?
<Page31>
"Arcueid, don't tell me that's...!?"
"It's Vlov. He's attacking people indiscriminately."
<Page32>
"He's insane. I was being too optimistic. He's no
different from one of the Dead. He's no more than a
beast that feeds on anyone in his sight when he lacks
blood. It's as if he's completely unable to grasp the
rules of the humans of this era―――of civilized
society."
<Page33>
I hear a loud explosion in the distance.
The black smoke rising into the night sky continues to
cloud it even further.
This is bad. This is way worse than what happened at
the hotel. If he appears in such a crowded downtown
area, the number of casualties will be orders of
magnitude higher!
<Page34>
"Arcueid...!"
"I know. We need to hurry, Shiki."
<Page35>
I start running toward the station.
What the hell is going on over there...!?
