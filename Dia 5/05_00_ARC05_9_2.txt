It has to be gliding.
No, more accurately closer to falling.
But can I do it...? It's up to fate whether or not I
make it.
<Page2>
It's not  by any stretch of the imagination. Even
if everything goes well, the impact of the landing will
tear my muscles and break my bones.
Will you really be able to endure that pain?
<Page3>
In the nick of time, I stop the projectiles that serve
to prod my indecisiveness.
That was close, thank goodness.
With that, my mind is made up.
I just need to bear the burden. From the beginning, I
have always been insensitive to the pain of death.
Just as he does, I too will focus only on killing
without a second's hesitation.
<Page4>
I turn around and run back toward Arcueid.
My energy is completely drained from all the excessive
movement.
I can't take even one more step forward.
The enemy I must approach is a distant fifty meters
away.
<Page5>
It doesn't matter.
In any case, the  distance has no bearing on
my choice.
<Page6>
"Arcueid, can you do that thing again from earlier?!"
"What do you mean by 'that thing'?!"
<Page7>
I tell Arcueid what I intend to do.
The explanation ends with a single word.
After a moment of bewilderment, she looks me in the
eyes with an expression of resignation that says
there's no other choice.
<Page8>
"If we do it on that scale, it will consume the last of
my remaining strength.
Knowing that, do you still want to do it? Escape will
no longer be a possibility."
<Page9>
It doesn't matter. I nod.
I can't spare enough strength to speak. Also hold on,
has she been looking for an opportunity like this the
entire time?!
<Page10>
"Huh? But wouldn't that mean you'll fall down halfway?
I can't really do anything to avoid that."
"Of course I'm going to fall! That's why―――"
<Page11>
Even though I wanted to bring my breathing under
control a little, I end up lecturing her in a loud
voice.
And over there―――
<Page12>
"―――!"
There's no time to explain.
A barrage of ice spears bears down on us. Vlov plans to
mercilessly skewer Arcueid through me.
<Page13>
"Just do it, there's no need to hold back! I don't care
if you overdo it! If you end up killing me, then so be
it!"
<Page14>
There's no time for pretense.
I take my gaze off Arcueid and stare at the enemy in
the distance.
The woman behind me, as though responding to my order,
says―――
<Page15>
"Yeah, leave it to me! I'll make sure that you win,
Shiki!"
