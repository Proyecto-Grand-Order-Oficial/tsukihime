"Okay, let's take a quick break.
You must be hungry, right Shiki? Do you want seconds of
what I made earlier? Or shall I make you something
else?"
<Page2>
"―――#No, I'll handle it.
I'll just help myself to the ingredients in the
fridge."
<Page3>
I don't usually judge a dish at first glance, but I
didn't have the guts to eat something that only used
the flavor of raw ingredients like that.
For a moment, I thought I could do it if I was in
perfect condition, but... no, even then, it'd still be
impossible.
I might not be able to avoid dealing with Vlov, but I
can at least avoid  hazard.
<Page4>
After eating a light meal, I resume my conversation
with Arcueid.
The question of what we're going to do has been
settled. All that remains is to work out how we're
going to do it.
The problem is those flames.
 Until we come up with some
sort of countermeasure, neither of us can get close to
him.
<Page5>
"I guess our only option is to take him by surprise...
It seems like you're the one he's after. We should have
you act as a decoy and lure him out.
While you do that, I'll hide somewhere and then jump
out and attack him from behind while he's still focused
on you... or something like that."
<Page6>
It's a pretty crude plan, but it's the only one I can
think of right now.
It doesn't solve the problem of getting close to him
with all those flames in the way, though...
<Page7>
"Yeah. I think a plan like that should work.
I'll be the decoy, and you'll be the one to take him
out. It doesn't matter how much energy he has in
reserve if you're the one who lands the finishing
blow."
<Page8>
"There are still other problems though.
Leaving me aside, you're the one that's going to fight
him head-on. What are you going to do about those
hand-like flames?"
<Page9>
"Hm? That shouldn't be a problem.
As soon as I got hit by them, I could tell that Vlov's
flames are only around 3000℃ or so. If I rebuild my
body to be more heat-resistant now, I should be able to
withstand them no problem."
<Page10>
"Huh...?"
Back up, what does she mean 'only' 3000℃?
Isn't that hot enough to melt rocks?
<Page11>
"The surrounding flames are much easier to handle.
Their contamination is only strong enough to cover the
surface, so when you come out of the shadows, I'll let
out a little shout and blow them away.
The only reason I couldn't do it back at the hotel is
because you were behind me."
<Page12>
A shout...?
It feels a bit too easy, but the fact is that she's
already saved my life once.
<Page13>
"Yup, that pretty much settles it.
First, I'll be the bait and lure out Vlov. Meanwhile,
you find somewhere to hide.
Then, when he appears, we'll fight for a little bit.
I'm not strong enough to defeat him as of tonight, but
I can at least put out the flames around him and hinder
his movement."
<Page14>
"What do you mean 'hinder his movement'? Don't tell me
that you're going to grab him and pin him to the ground
from above or something."
<Page15>
"I'm not going to do anything that uncivilized.
It would be futile to hold him down directly. Besides,
I've never done it before, nor do I feel the need to."
<Page16>
"I-I see. In that case, how do you plan on subduing
him?"
"Exactly how I do it will depend on the location, but
the long and short of it is that I'll be using chains."
<Page17>
"Chains? You mean like  chains?"
"Yeah. You know, something like this."
"!?"
W-What the, my hands are bound by chains all of a
sudden...!?
Wait, where did these chains even come from!?
<Page18>
"They're formed by immobilizing the elements in the
air. I find this shape easy to visualize.# As for how
strong they are... at the moment, each chain could
probably hold about a hundred tons? I'll pile a couple
dozen of these on him, which should cut off his
movement at the very least."
<Page19>
"I'll try and restrain him by just wrapping chains
around his limbs, and leave his torso and head visible.
That way you have something to aim for when you go in
to cut his lines of death."
<Page20>
"O-Okay, I get it. I get it, so please untie me. I can
feel my hands being ripped off! They're gonna be torn
off before I can even fight Vlov!"
<Page21>
The chains that had suddenly appeared begin to fade
away, disappearing as if vanishing into thin air.
Once again, I am forced to contend with the sheer
ludicrousness of Arcueid's existence...
<Page22>
Still, if she can create those chains at will, she
should have no trouble pinning Vlov down for a bit.
<Page23>
"Um... like I was saying!
If I see an opening while we're fighting, I'll bind
Vlov's limbs with my chains.
I'll only be able to restrain him for around ten
seconds, so when I do, you'll have to burst out, take
the shortest possible route, and launch a head-on
attack on his lines.
Don't worry. With skills like yours, he'll be dead in
no time."
<Page24>
"What do you mean 'head-on'..."
Arcueid said it casually, but I'm pretty uneasy about
all this.
<Page25>
"No, we shouldn't base our plans on something we've
never tried before.
On second thought, I'll find some way to approach him
from behind and cut the 'lines' on his limbs. If I do
that, he won't be able to move around anymore―――"
<Page26>
That way there'll be no need for Arcueid to 'fight'
him.
The choice to fight should only be made if my surprise
attack fails.
With that in mind, I look at her face―――
<Page27>
"―――Shiki. If you do that, you will die."
"Huh―――?"
<Page28>
"This is not a matter of how to do things safely.
We're not talking about how to avoid death, we're
talking about how to kill."
<Page29>
"Well that's―――true I guess."
"You're about to go up against a vampire.
That's why you must throw away your sense of morality,
even if it's just for tonight. Carrying around that
burden will only weigh you down when the time comes."
<Page30>
"That much I can understand... Our opponent is a
monster after all, which is why I'm willing to lend a
hand."
<Page31>
"No, you don't understand at all, Shiki.
Cutting off a limb? You should give up on such a
suicidal act. If you have the time to cut off a limb,
you should use that time to sever his life instead. It
would be different if he were any other creature, but
this is something only you can do.
Do you get it? Don't give Vlov a chance to fight back.
The only advantage you have is that he doesn't know
about your ability."
<Page32>
The look in Arcueid's eyes leaves no room for argument.
Her red eyes assert that fact:
'If you miss your first shot, there won't be another
chance.'
<Page33>
She's right...
It's just like she said. While I leisurely waste my
time cutting off his limbs, my body will be completely
reduced to ashes―――
<Page34>
"Vlov will show himself when night falls.
When that time comes, we―――no, you and I must both
go in with the intent to completely massacre him.
Don't think about how you can come out of this alive.
Think only about how you can kill him. Nothing more."
<Page35>
Arcueid gazes straight at me with her deadly eyes.
She's really angry...
She's angry at the fact that I still harbor such naïve
thoughts.
<Page36>
"―――Fine. I won't hesitate.
I'll cut all of his lines in one go.
That should be fine, right, Arcueid?"
<Page37>
"........."
Arcueid's gaze remains stern.
She isn't replying... Which probably means she's at
least satisfied with my answer.
<Page38>
"But where should I wait for him?
If we stay in this apartment, it'll just be a repeat of
what happened at the hotel. If there's some unpopulated
place where I could hide..."
<Page39>
"The park at the center of the city is our best bet.
It's deserted at night after all.#
―――And if there do happen to be people passing by,
then that's just their own bad luck."
<Page40>
Arcueid turns her back and averts her gaze.
"What...? If you've got something to say, then say it."
<Page41>
"You can't do it. After all, you haven't said the word
'kill' even once.
At this rate, you will hesitate at the very last
moment. And then you'll be killed before you even know
it."
<Page42>
"As if that would happen. That guy is a monster that
killed over a hundred people. There's no way that I'd
ever hesitate to kill him."
"―――――――"
Arcueid breathes a tiny sigh.
<Page43>
"I'd be able to take down Vlov for sure if I just
enchanted you with my Mystic Eyes... I'm not sure why,
but even though this is the first time I've thought
about doing it, I just can't bring myself to go through
with it.
It's like some sort of contradiction."
<Page44>
"I'll believe in you, Shiki. Let's defeat Vlov
together."
Arcueid turns around, her cheerful expression a far cry
from her previous gloomy tone.
<Page45>
I wonder why...
Even though her eyes are filled with trust, I can't
help but sense a terrible apprehension in her smile.
