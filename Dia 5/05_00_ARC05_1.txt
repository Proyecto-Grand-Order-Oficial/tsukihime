Arcueid's room isn't exactly what I'd have expected of
a vampire.
Last time I was here, I wasn't really paying any
attention to the room itself. Now that I am though, I
see that it's pretty mundane.
<Page2>
There are no bottles filled with human blood.
Nor can I spot any bizarre sculptures or anything like
that.
<Page3>
"She's even got tableware and a refrigerator...
What's up with this woman?"
<Page4>
I lay Arcueid down on the bed as I grumble.
Although her body's light, carrying her all the way
here wasn't easy.
<Page5>
"..."
I sit on the floor and take a deep breath.
It's almost seven o'clock in the morning.
<Page6>
"Oh yeah... I'd better close the curtains."
<Page7>
I whip my sluggish body back into shape and go close
the curtains.
I've done everything I can. Now I should finally be
able to relax.
But on my way to go sit down, my knees give out and I
fall to the floor with a thud.
<Page8>
"How pathetic... To think that I'm this worn out just
from carrying a single girl."
<Page9>
Ever since the accident, I've had a hard time
recovering from injuries.
Which isn't to say that I don't get enough exercise.
The Arimas had a dojo, so back when I lived with them,
I'd exercise all the time.
<Page10>
After all, for someone with a weak body, even a common
cold can become a matter of life and death.
I'm proud to say that my fundamental physical strength
is on par with the average person. However, there's no
way for me to improve my endurance.
I'm like a track and field athlete who can do short
sprints, but not a marathon.
<Page11>
"..."
I'm so tired that I can't even get up.
On top of having talked with Arcueid all night, I
haven't had a decent meal in over a day.
It's crazy that I've lasted this long.
<Page12>
"Arcueid... I wonder if she'll be okay with those
wounds...?"
I steal a glance at the woman lying on the bed.
Her abdomen has stopped bleeding, and even if she's
torn from limb to limb, she can simply come back to
life. Maybe there's no reason to be worried after all.
<Page13>
"What the hell am I doing...?"
This fever is making me lightheaded.
I'm so exhausted I can barely breathe, and yet here I
am worrying over  condition. I guess I must've come
down with something pretty serious―――
<Page14>
"―――The crash is believed to have been caused by an
unknown malfunction in the motorcycle's brake pedal,
causing it to fall off of the sudden drop at the side
of the road.
Two people were injured, but fortunately, no one was
killed."
<Page15>
"Did I fall asleep...?"
It seems that I passed out where I lay on the floor.
For some reason, the curtains are open and there's a
bedsheet covering my body.
<Page16>
It's just past noon.
There's no sign of Arcueid on the bed, and the TV has
been left broadcasting a steady stream of dull news.
<Page17>
"Where'd she go...?"
I sit up and look around the room.
I feel a person's presence coming from the neighboring
room... the kitchen.
<Page18>
"What is she doing, moving around in her state?"
I move the sheet away and stand up.
I need to go to the kitchen immediately and check on
her wounds.
<Page19>
"And for our next story.
A fire erupted today in the early morning at the
Kuramibashi Dome Hotel. None of the internal fire
alarms went off, and as a result, the fire went
unreported until staff returning to work at six o'clock
discovered the irregularity inside the hotel and
contacted the authorities.
As of now, they are currently working together with
firefighters to combat the flames inside."
<Page20>
"―――――"
I stop dead in my tracks.
I can't help but be glued to the news footage.
<Page21>
"The safety of the 200 guests who were staying in the
hotel has yet to be confirmed. The firefighters are
presently working at a rapid pace to extinguish the
fire. However, thus far not a single victim has been
discovered inside the hotel―――"
<Page22>
The newscaster reads out the news dispassionately.
The screen changes, showing the exterior of the hotel
where we just were, along with a list of the names of
the two hundred missing guests.
Neither mine nor Arcueid's name is on the list.
<Page23>
"In addition, according to the police report, the
damage to parts of the walls within the hotel has led
to theories that the incident was caused not by a
regular fire, but by an explosion as a result of
structural defects within the hotel―――"
<Page24>
With a click, I turn off the TV.
"――――"
<Page25>
The safety of the guests has yet to be confirmed―――?
Not a single victim has been discovered―――?
How can you say that when it's already so clear what
happened?
Everyone who stayed at the hotel was engulfed in those
unfathomable flames, reduced to ashes without leaving a
single trace.
<Page26>
"――――"
I hold back my nausea.
I can't think back on that tragedy or I'll end up
vomiting.
Wallowing in self-pity in this situation would make me
worse than a pig.
As the only one who escaped that hotel with his life
intact, I cannot allow myself to feel anything but
hatred.
<Page27>
Two hundred people.
Two hundred human beings were slaughtered arbitrarily,
and their bodies desecrated.
<Page28>
That vampire's face looms over my thoughts.
I don't know what kind of person he is.
But I do know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that he is
the cause of all this.
―――That's right.
The only thing I know for certain is that he's someone
who cannot be allowed to live.
<Page29>
"――――――"
I wonder if my heart is still numb...
I still feel the fear I felt back then.
My rage continues to swirl intensely.
And yet, my thoughts are turning cold.
<Page30>
It's like my heart and mind have become separate.
Just thinking about that cloaked man makes me want to
scream, yet the sharp sensation in my fingertips
continues to grow.
I don't need such useless feelings. I don't need more
reasons to be angry either.
There is only one thing I must do. And that is to
simply cut those―――
