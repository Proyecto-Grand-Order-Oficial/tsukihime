"Well, you're not wrong.
I'd really prefer a pair though. Two women, or a man
and a woman."
"It's fine though. Welcome to the club, Otaku-kun!
The recent lack of challengers has been a real pain! If
we don't meet our quota, we'll be killed too!"
<Page2>
Letting out a cackle, the man called Haru circles
around to my back.
He blocks my path of retreat.
<Page3>
"Well, I guess it's fine to have a lone guy once in a
while.
I'll take you to the part-time venue."
The man named Haru pushes the button for the elevator.
<Page4>
A mechanical sound echoes in the darkness.
It seems to be the only thing here connected to power.
<Page5>
"Get in."
"......"
I don't know if I should get into the elevator...
Once I enter, I'll be locked inside.
If the two men were to seize me, I wouldn't be strong
enough to resist.
<Page6>
I need to be careful here...
I should――
1. Ask for more information. ^@t2. Refuse.
"...!"
A sudden impact knocks me unconscious.
My hypothalamus malfunctions.
The autonomic nerves controlling my limbs disconnect.
<Page7>
"Yeah! "
I hear a lively voice coming from behind me...
I was hit in the back of the head with some kind of
bat.
<Page8>
"What a pain in the ass.
This ain't no time to get all worked up, you shithead."
<Page9>
The elevator descends...
In my dazed state, I dimly register that the button
labeled 'B1' is glowing.
B1... The first basement floor... Are they sending me
to an underground parking lot...?
<Page10>
Shit...
My consciousness is stable, but my vision is blurry.
My arms and legs are twitching up and down even though
I'm not telling them to.
With my face fallen flat against the floor, I can feel
something slimy. Something disgusting.
<Page11>
As the elevator doors open, we're illuminated by an
intense light.
It's too bright to see what's going on outside.
"We're dropping him. Gimme a hand."
"Sheesh, you're skipping P and going straight to M!?
How ruthless, Toshi!"
<Page12>
The duo lift up my body, carry me out of the elevator,
and lay me on the floor.
I half expected them to just toss me out, but they're
being strangely careful.
<Page13>
Their footsteps recede.
The duo get back in the elevator and leave the area.
<Page14>
"―――――――――"
I've managed to scrape through somehow.
I'm still alive. It's a serious wound, but it's not
fatal.
<Page15>
I don't know where I am, but in a few more minutes, the
paralysis in my limbs will subside and I'll be able to
move again.
As soon as I can move, I can fight back.
<Page16>
This time I'll be on my guard. I'll get a hold of one
of those two, and then I'll be the one asking―――
<Page17>
"―――Huh?"
The last remaining piece of my consciousness freezes in
its tracks.
<Page18>
What is this place?
    ―――An atmosphere slick as a mucous membrane.
What is this place?
    ―――The stench of fat, meat, and blood.
What is this place?
    ―――A myriad of prison bars and living corpses.
What is this place...?
<Page19>
This is not an underground parking space.
This is not a place on Earth.
There's no way that a cesspool like this could exist in
the city I live in.
<Page20>
" ―――"
Something is coming. I hear a multitude of footsteps
approaching.
I have a headache.
I feel nauseous.
The footsteps are getting closer.
My instincts are screaming that if I stay here, I'll be
attacked.
<Page21>
" ―――"
My legs still refuse to move.
A large crowd gradually approaches, their rotten flesh
trailing behind them.
"―――!"
I can't move. I can't move.
My legs won't even budge, even as I cry and pour all of
my strength into them!
<Page22>
"  ―――!"
I crawl along the blood and feces-stained floor with my
hands.
I need to do something, .
I need to get out of here as soon as possible.
The elevator.
If I can get back to that elevator, I'm sure I'll be
able to return to the normal world.
<Page23>
I need to hurry.
I need to hurry.
Faster. Faster.
It's okay, I'm going to make it.
I will definitely be saved.
That elevator. That elevator.
If only I could just reach the elevator, stuck in the
air like a gondola―――
