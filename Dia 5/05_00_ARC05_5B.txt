<Page1>
She was just like a human missile.
Arcueid descended upon Vlov from a height of eighty
meters.
<Page2>
No, it was more like she flew into him.
While in the air, she took aim and angled herself
before accelerating like a missile.
<Page3>
Earth and debris billow up into the air.
The wind whips up a cloud of dust that scours the area.
The river of flame that had been flowing through the
downtown area is halted in its tracks by that single
blow.
<Page4>
It blows away the policemen that had been surrounding
Vlov, incapacitating most of them in the process. Half
of them are struck in the head and knocked unconscious,
and the rest simply lose their will to fight.
It's not surprising.
<Page5>
"A-Amazi..."
Once the dust settles, the extent of the destruction is
plain to see.
Arcueid's rapid descent shatters the ground around
Vlov, and causes a corner of the north gate――a
significant chunk of the downtown area――to sink
underground.
<Page6>
So this is what she meant by 'dropping them
underground'.
The land has sunk over forty meters.
<Page7>
It felt like watching an incredible force of nature.
Its grandeur is on the same level as the Amazon jungle
or Niagara Falls.
"Don't you know how to restrain yourself, you
idiot――――!"
Of course, I'm not praising her in the slightest.
<Page8>
"But  that was cool. Was that an accident, or was
it part of her plan!?"
As far as I can tell from the rooftop, there aren't any
fatalities.
The policemen who were outside the blast radius have
tended to the knocked-out officers and withdrawn from
the site of impact.
<Page9>
As a result, the entire area is now completely
deserted.
This―――this method of clearing people out is way too
over the top...!
<Page10>
"......!"
Were those Vlov's flames just now?
I don't know if Arcueid missed or if Vlov somehow
managed to dodge, but either way, he's still alive.
<Page11>
Even after that attack, the monster refuses to go
down...
As if hunting him down―――
A white shadow challenges the originator of the flames
in the cloud of dust.
<Page12>
'Make sure you follow after me―――'
Arcueid's words resurface in my mind.
I'll have time to think later.
Right now, I need to hurry down to ground level...!
<Page13>
"   ―――!"
I run over to the stairs.
I cut the lock on the door to the rooftop with my
knife.
<Page14>
"  ―――..."
I dash down the stairs, relying on the emergency
lights.
My resolve, like my breathing, becomes more and more
ragged as I go.
<Page15>
All I have to do is cut through Vlov's 'lines'.
First, Arcueid will fight him and then restrain him
with her chains.
After that, it'll be my turn.
I'll sprint up to him, cut his lines, and dismantle his
body.
<Page16>
Arcueid's descent back there was extraordinary.
So I believe Vlov can definitely be pinned down.
However―――
<Page17>
"―――But, even so―――"
Even so, Vlov is in excellent condition.
Does Arcueid's previous evaluation still hold?
If she happens to be wrong, there's also the fact that
she's been handicapped by her wound.
<Page18>
In the worst-case scenario, I would have to fight Vlov
alone―――
No, that won't happen.
We didn't make any plans for the worst-case scenario.
It's not like we didn't consider it, but there's just
no reason to.
<Page19>
Because if Vlov defeats Arcueid, the only choice I
would have left would be to run away.
<Page20>
"――――――."
I reach the elevator.
I rush inside and press the button for the first floor.
There's no more time for hesitation.
There was never any time to hesitate in the first
place.
I take a deep breath. I give my body a once-over. It
seems to be in working order for now.
<Page21>
Only the fingers gripping my knife refuse to move. It's
as if they aren't even part of my own body.
<Page22>
"――――――"
Could this be fear?
Am I afraid of confronting the violence... of
confronting that monster?
If that's what it is, then there's no problem.
It's only natural that a human being would be afraid of
that . Afraid of confronting a being that you
can't even approach without coming face-to-face with
death. Could you really call yourself human if you
aren't afraid of that?
<Page23>
That's why―――
If there was a problem, it would be―――
<Page24>
"――――――"
It would be if―――
I felt more afraid of killing than of being killed.
<Page25>
"―――――."
My breathing speeds up.
My heart is pounding restlessly, like it's detached
from my body entirely.
<Page26>
I reach the first floor.
I adjust my grip on the knife and run toward the newly
formed crater.
