"――――――"
The cold air cuts my skin.
My body temperature drops.
The intense cold makes it difficult just to .
My brain creaks as if it's being squeezed by my skull.
<Page2>
My heart, already fit to burst, is ripped clean in two
when I imagine what's going to happen in the next two
minutes.
<Page3>
Corpses swarm toward Arcueid.
A procession that calls to mind midsummer in the face
of this extreme cold.
Like ants gathering sugar under the blazing sun.
They're going to kill Arcueid.
Those corpses are here to tear her limb from
limb――just as <I|Y o u > had――and offer up her dismembered
body.
<Page4>
All while I watch from a safe distance.
Just like that―――#Just like that?
<Page5>
"―――I can't."
That thing is just a disaster in human form.
I shouldn't have pursued him.
It was beyond arrogant of me to think that I could
defeat him.
<Page6>
Stop him from killing anyone else?
Resolve the situation without any more casualties?
How foolish. I should have looked the other way. I
shouldn't have confronted that monster. As with a
typhoon, there's no option but to let it pass. If I had
done that, then the city may have only ended up being
burned to the ground.
<Page7>
"―――But, I can't."
She, who could do nothing. Me, who chose to do nothing.
She, who wasn't even armed. Me, who carried a weapon.
Common sense and irrationality writhe within my
pressurized brain.
My consciousness turns to my rear, telling me to run.
There's nothing I can do to stop it.
It's no use after all. What could I possibly do against
an opponent like that? That woman. From here on, I'm
totally out of my depth. That woman. I should just run
away. Just look away. Any  human would. That
woman―――will be killed.
<Page8>
I turn to the sky. Everywhere I look, I see frozen
buildings.
All those people, wiped out in an instant. I doubt they
even had time to scream.
The scene at the hotel last night. I think back to the
pleas of those people who were also killed without
purpose.
The fallen figure. The corpses drool sloppily as they
draw near the <woman|f l e s h   >. The expanding river of ice.
Throughout, the vampire continues to observe the death
of the city with indifference―――
<Page9>
"――――――There's no doubt about it."
My skull cracks. Under these freezing conditions, my
heart pumps blood ferociously.
That is, in other words―――
<Page10>
"――――――I cannot allow this."
All of the fear running down my spine transforms into
anger.
I'm defective. A laughingstock. Far too immature as a
human.# After all,# not a single atom in my body can
tolerate just standing by and observing―――!
<Page11>
I take off my glasses.
I cover my mouth with my left hand, desperately trying
to hold back my shivering and prevent any more warmth
from escaping.
<Page12>
One minute, no, three minutes.
I firmly etch this time constraint into my mind.
I'm not worried about losing my nerve. Three minutes is
simply the longest a human can survive down in that
pit.
<Page13>
"Shit―――shit, shit, shit―――!
What the hell am I doing―――!"
<Page14>
I berate myself as I descend the slope.
This is ridiculous. I'm being foolish. I really am an
idiot.
<Page15>
Run away because I don't want to die?
That's backwards. If that's your goal, you need to do
the opposite.
That thing cannot be tolerated.
That thing cannot be allowed to go unchecked.
Running away will undoubtedly lead to death. Not only
for myself, but for the entire city.
<Page16>
In that case, it's obvious what I must do.
If you don't want to die, then kill. Run for the sake
of survival.
Kill that thing right here, right now, without waiting
even a second.
<Page17>
I've pretty much run out of patience at this point.
That thing killed, robbed, and survived without a
second thought.
As a different <organism|p e r s o n   >, I cannot allow him to reside
in the same plane of existence.
Whatever it may be, if it's alive then it's my prey.
Right here, I'll put an end to the core of his very
existence...!
<Page18>
I run toward Arcueid.
The corpses are trying to sink their teeth into her
body.
<Page19>
The question from earlier of whether I could kill them
or not comes to mind.
Can I kill something that looks like a person,
regardless of whether or not it's really human?
<Page20>
―――It doesn't matter.
My head simply hurts right now.
The first time I've looked with my bare eyes for so
long.
The first time I've acted so objectively.
As I look down on the lines of death in a frenzy――
I memorize the images of the corpses I must kill.
Don't touch her. You're an eyesore. The dead should not
eat the living.
Besides―――
The only creature that's allowed to prey on that woman
is .
<Page21>
I cut the lines of the three corpses.
Each of them is split into three pieces. Like a hot
knife through butter, the corpses are split open and
perish.
Too easy. Their attention was focused on Arcueid after
all. How can you even be that defenseless?
<Page22>
"Wake up! How long are you going to stay asleep
for...!"
There's no need to come in contact with Arcueid.
I call out to her as I kill the fourth corpse.
<Page23>
"Mmm... Shi... ki?"
Perhaps regaining consciousness as a result of my call,
Arcueid weakly opens her eyes.
<Page24>
"W-What are you doing here? You need to... get out of
here...!"
<Page25>
As Arcueid begins to sit up, her face contorts and she
doubles over.
She's back to being conscious. Her life is still
intact. But her wound has not healed.
<Page26>
She can't yet move from here.
The one that should be running is her, not me. But
unfortunately, I cannot allow her that luxury.
<Page27>
"Okay, you're fine. That's good. Back me up if you
can."
"Back you up―――you're telling me that you're going
in alone!? Are you insane!?"
"Would I be here if I wasn't?
Listen, this place is like the bottom of the ocean for
me. I only have three minutes. That's why in that
time―――"
<Page28>
"This time for sure. We'll kill that bastard together
and end this."
<Page29>
I leave Arcueid behind and run.
I adjust my grip on the knife and measure the distance
between me and Vlov.
It's about forty meters.
Six seconds until contact. He still hasn't seen me yet.
<Page30>
―――Three seconds left.
No time to wait and see. I'll finish him off with one
blow.
My body is already in a state of flux.
<Page31>
I had three minutes in total before my body and
consciousness shut down due to the low temperature.
One of those minutes has already elapsed.
That leaves plenty of time. I can already see
them―――
The lines of death that will 'kill' this monster.
<Page32>
The man finally reacts.
With the manner of someone brushing off an insect, he
turns his gaze as if to intercept me.
The giant lance that skewered Arcueid is nowhere to be
seen.
Of course it is. I'd be in trouble if he still had it.
<Page33>
In Vlov's eyes, I'm no different from the Corpses.
He treats me as an incompetent 'thing' that only
protects Arcueid.
A worthless existence, just like all the other frail
<humans|c r e a t u r e s   > he's crushed underfoot before.
<Page34>
"――――――."
That's why I have a chance.
The only thing I can do is take him by surprise.
He's already seen me. I can't attack him from behind.
<Page35>
And yet, I can still take him by surprise.
He doesn't know about my eyes.
He hasn't even considered that a mere human might have
the means to kill an immortal vampire with a single
blow.
<Page36>
Two seconds left.
I only have to do it once―――to take that risk, to
cross the border between life and death.
I'll dodge his first move. That's my sole focus.
If I can just make it through that gamble, then all I
have to do is cut that line―――
<Page37>
"―――!"
At the very last second.
Right at the moment we were about to cross swords, the
both of us jump back simultaneously.
We never even came within striking distance of each
other.
<Page38>
There are two reasons.
For one, I made a mistake.
I can't get close to his chest. He is the focal point
of this swirling icy wind. The closer I get, the more
sluggish my body becomes. Even at running speed, the
moment I'm within two meters of him I'd lose
consciousness, unable to take another step.
And that's the minimum requirement for a surprise
attack.
Getting in close for the kill simply isn't possible
against Vlov.
<Page39>
But that's okay. As a matter of fact, I had already
taken that possibility into consideration.
However, there is another problem.
This one is far more deadly.
<Page40>
'You bastard―――!'
The headache caused by my exposed eyes blends with my
own rage.
<Page41>
I don't believe this. Of all the things that could
happen, that bastard managed to see through me.
It must have been his intuition.
An awareness of death that surpasses that of a beast.
Despite having no reason to think so, that guy suddenly
realized that the enemy had a means to kill him, and
was afraid. Having recognized me as a threat, he leapt
away without even a second's hesitation.
<Page42>
"Why... did I... retreat...?"
My retreat was a mere two meters at best.
But his retreat was extraordinary. He flew back thirty
meters.
I guess that must be the 'minimum safe distance' for a
vampire. I can't help but laugh at the staggering
difference in specs between the two of us.
<Page43>
"You. What... are you...?"
"――――――"
That should be my line.
<Page44>
This is the worst possible situation. I can't bridge
the distance anymore.
I've accepted that it's impossible to defeat him.
And he's sensed I have a way to kill him.
It's clear how things will go from here―――
<Page45>
"Good... Stay back. You can stand there and ."
It will be a one-sided slaughter from afar.
