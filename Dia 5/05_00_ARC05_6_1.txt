The location of the enemy is clear.
Down in that pit stands Vlov, who we've come to
defeat―――
Along with Arcueid, who I promised to fight alongside.
<Page2>
The battle between those two has already begun.
That's okay... My role here isn't to fight, it's to
finish the job.
As soon as Arcueid gets a hold of Vlov, I come in and
sever his 'lines'.
And for that reason―――
<Page3>
"That's right. I can't get cold feet now...!"
I slide down the slope of rubble and descend into the
crater.
I immediately cover my nose and mouth with my hand.
I don't do it on purpose; it's a defensive reflex to
protect my own life.
<Page4>
"―――"
I can't breathe.
There is oxygen down here. These blue flames are like a
curse, there's no actual matter combusting. That much
was established at the hotel.
<Page5>
But that doesn't change the fact that it's sweltering
down here. If I breathe normally, the hot air will burn
my lungs to a crisp.
<Page6>
Ahead of me, I can see one vampire in white, and
another in a black cloak.
Sword clashing with claw.
Even in this heat, Arcueid is laying into Vlov with an
unrelenting offense.
<Page7>
As far as I can tell, Arcueid has the upper hand.
If things continue to go according to plan, she'll get
a hold of Vlov.
The problem is―――
<Page8>
"―――――――――"
It's a matter of how long my body can last.
My body# is already# starting to burn.
<Page9>
But strangely, I don't feel any pain.
I don't need to breathe to know what's going on.
With the knife in my hand, I continue to wait for my
chance to defeat Vlov.
Like a sprinter waiting for the starting gun.
Or a ghost who will never move again.
<Page10>
I'll keep waiting.
And waiting.
And waiting.
Even as my eyeballs dry up, smolder, and turn to ashes,
I wait.
The moment will never come.
Just as I never come to realize that I've become little
more than burnt up film.
