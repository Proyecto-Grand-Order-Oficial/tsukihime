<Page1>
I can't go down like this.
The floor of the pit is completely covered in blue
flames.
<Page2>
A tall vampire stands at the center.
Vlov Arkhangel.
He was right at the center of that explosion, but
there's not a scratch on him.
By human standards, he's practically an immortal
monster.
And then―――
<Page3>
There is the white figure toying with the man from the
front.
A beautiful huntress, darting through the garden of
flickering flames and debris.
<Page4>
Of course, that white figure is Arcueid.
She leaps across the river of fire and closes in on
Vlov.
<Page5>
He has a crude yet deadly weapon gripped in his hand.
Although it has the appearance of a long sword, the
blade is that of a machete.
Arcueid on the other hand is fighting empty-handed.
Using the force of her legs alone, she closes in on
Vlov. And then―――
<Page6>
She exchanges blows with Vlov's machete using just her
claws, forcing the tall figure to retreat...!
<Page7>
There's a single gash on his arm, so deep you can see
straight through to the bone.
It's only there for an instant. The arm sliced open by
Arcueid's claws is healed by the very blood that pours
forth from it.
<Page8>
Arcueid had told me that so long as a vampire has
blood, they are immortal and possess an abundance of
life force.
It's exactly as she said.
In the blink of an eye, the wound that would've killed
a normal creature has disappeared as though it were
never there.
<Page9>
The massive weapon is swung without hesitation.
Arcueid keeps her distance.
After each strike, she moves out of his range and
prepares for her next attack.
<Page10>
Is she just being cautious of Vlov's counterattacks...?
No, that's not it.
That face... Is she enjoying cornering him...?
<Page11>
"Is being tough to kill the only redeeming feature you
have?
The quality of the   has really
gone downhill. Are you really going to let me kill you
like this without revealing your trump card?"
<Page12>
"―――――――――"
Vlov's breathing has become erratic.
His sickly-pale face is etched with pain and anguish.
<Page13>
Vlov is most definitely immortal...
But even that has limits.
He may  unharmed, but there's no doubt that
Arcueid's dive-bombing dealt him a fatal wound.
<Page14>
Keeping his body regenerated is the best he can do.
It's the same as when I killed Arcueid. It stands to
reason that he's squandering the majority of his energy
just to keep reviving.
<Page15>
In fact, Arcueid seems to have come to the same
conclusion.
That's why she's keeping her distance after every
attack.
She's inviting Vlov to perform one final attack. A
counterattack with all his might.
<Page16>
Countless clashing sounds echo through the air.
Vlov's breathing grows even more frantic.
"―――No, that's―――"
A sense of unease that I can't put into words.
Arcueid has the upper hand. It's clear that Vlov is
being worn down.
And yet, as a bystander, I feel a growing sense of
dread in my chest.
<Page17>
The dread stems from the fact that Vlov is taking far
fewer hits from Arcueid's claws than he was a little
while ago.
<Page18>
His swordsmanship... Well, I guess , is
also much more formidable than one would expect given
his appearance.
<Page19>
On top of that, it's clear that he's already able to
see right through Arcueid's speed and movements. But
most importantly of all―――
He still hasn't used his 'flaming hand'...!
<Page20>
"――――――!!!!!"
"―――!"
<Page21>
Vlov lets out a roar.
With his bellow of rage, the inferno intensifies.
The apocalyptic flames reach a height of several
meters.
The river of fire splits into dozens of streams.
<Page22>
The pit has turned into an underground colosseum filled
with a forest of fire.
The walls of flame block Arcueid's escape.
And with the stage set―――
<Page23>
A 'hand' of unparalleled heat is unleashed toward
Arcueid, melting the rubble in its path.
<Page24>
"Arcueid―――!"
In an instant.
The tide of battle is completely reversed.
<Page25>
Arcueid said that she could withstand temperatures of
up to 3000℃.
However, the 'hand' that melted the rubble with ease
has a temperature well over that.
<Page26>
Three more of those 'hands' pile down on her. Not even
ashes will remain at this rate. There's no escape from
the tormenting tongue of flame as it licks its prey
clean.
The white figure burns away without a trace.
―――At least, that's what  have occurred if this
had happened last night.
<Page27>
The flames are torn apart.
A white skirt flutters in the wind.
Enraptured, I'm unable to tear my eyes away from her
transformation.
<Page28>
I recall her saying something earlier.
Something about having a countermeasure, and rebuilding
her body in advance.
<Page29>
Vlov's flames seem to mean nothing to her in that black
and white combat dress.
Is the dress absorbing the flames? Or is she herself
now impervious to them now that she's rebuilt her body?
<Page30>
Either way, the flames can't touch her now.
Arcueid's countermeasure is flawless.
Her victory was decided the moment she identified her
opponent as a monster of flames back at the hotel.
<Page31>
A 'hand' of flame is unleashed.
Arcueid casually thrusts out her left hand.
With a move like she's combing her hair, she disperses
the towering walls of flame that surrounded her.
<Page32>
The walls of flame bow their heads, submitting to the
white dress.
Her golden hair whips about like a shower of shooting
stars.
<Page33>
Her claws fly through the air and rain down on Vlov
with power unlike anything I've ever seen before.
As he helplessly retreats, her claws strike a second
time, then a third.
<Page34>
An overwhelming difference in ability.
This is no longer a battle.
As soon as his flames were neutralized, Vlov became
mere prey to be hunted.
Arcueid's claws continue to unrelentingly inflict
accurate, mortal wounds into Vlov's flesh.
<Page35>
Vlov is probably only still standing because he has
some blood remaining.
But even that is going to run out at some point.
Unfortunately for him, there aren't any humans around
to 'extract' resources from.
The only blood he has left is that which flows within
his own body.
And that won't last more than a few more blows.
<Page36>
In other words, he's bankrupt.
Without the energy to revive, he'll return back to his
rightful state as a corpse.
<Page37>
"―――Stop... it―――"
He begs for his life without any pretense.
Just like a child throwing a tantrum.
His mastery of the machete is also lost.
He swings it haphazardly, as if to dispel the fearful
sight in front of him. But Arcueid is not going to let
such a clumsy opening pass by.
<Page38>
"It's cold―――it's cold―――this place is...
cold―――!"
Screaming, the vampire leaps.
Mustering the last of his <blood|s t r e n g t h   >, Vlov jumps backwards.
No, .
<Page39>
He jumps from the floor of the pit toward the surface.
Even a height of forty meters isn't enough to stop a
vampire.
It's likely that he is planning to replenish his blood
supply on the surface.
<Page40>
Green ivy twists around his legs.
The ivy sprouts from beneath the rubble at a terrifying
speed, grabs Vlov's feet, and pulls him back to earth.
<Page41>
"――― ―――!"
A river of flame appears once again at Vlov's feet.
Engulfed by a fire that burns only life, the green ivy
is reduced to ash.
However, his shackles do not vanish.
New ivy, fertilized by the ashes, entwines itself
around him.
<Page42>
No matter how many times he burns it away, he cannot
break free. Like a phoenix, it returns again and again.
That's right. If vampires are considered immortal, then
the workings of nature are also an eternal, endless
cycle.
<Page43>
That ivy is a manifestation of that. He cannot escape
them without a fire capable of burning down the planet
itself.
For Vlov... or rather, for a vampire with a 'curse' his
size, snuffing out Arcueid's breath is something that's
simply impossible...!
<Page44>
―――Arcueid runs.
From the intensity of her stance, I can tell that this
is the finishing blow.
<Page45>
All of Vlov's counterattacks have been thwarted.
With this, she has decided to end it all.
I feel the same.
There is no need to wait for my assistance. At this
rate, Arcueid will crush him to pieces.
<Page46>
And yet...
And yet, I can't help but be apprehensive.
Something is wrong.
His agony, his breathing, they entreat me to notice
what's amiss.
<Page47>
Vlov's complexion and anguish have become even more
ghoulish.
Within that scorching heat, he exists in his own
 .
His breath is white, as if the world he exists in is
the polar opposite of ours.
<Page48>
I know those eyes...
The instinct for both fight  flight.
He is simultaneously both the perpetrator and the
victim.
That's why―――
――――――We are definitely making a fatal error.
<Page49>
"You idiot... What the hell am I thinking...!?"
Arcueid's victory is inevitable.
There's no way I'd interfere at a time like this.
<Page50>
I don't have to do anything.
There's no need for me to go out of my way and enter
that hellscape.
Knowing that, I―――
C:> Have no choice but to watch the battle from here.
C:> Call out to Arcueid to stop.
