"――――――"
To be honest, I can't stand letting Vlov off the hook
for even a second.
But... going after him now would be too reckless.
<Page2>
Tracking him down and defeating him as we are right
now? It's not even worth considering.
That kind of wishful thinking is just an irresponsible
escape from reality to ease my own guilt.
<Page3>
I need to collect myself...
I have to if I really want to defeat that vampire.
I understand that if I  wish to reduce the number
of casualties, I've got no choice but to wait here.
<Page4>
But still―――three days is far too long.
<Page5>
"...Arcueid.
You said that my duty as your guard ended yesterday,
right?"
<Page6>
"I did, but... what? Are you getting cold feet after
all?"
"No, that's not what I mean. If we're doing this as a
team and not out of obligation, then I have a favor to
ask of you.
I'll do as you say. I'll obey your commands. I may not
be able to act as your shield, but I can at least
become your knife.
So, in return―――"
<Page7>
"In return?"
"―――I can't wait three days. Let's lure him out
tonight."
<Page8>
"Um... are you serious?"
She's taken aback by my suicidal remark.
I know full well just how dangerous this is going to
be. Even so, there's a line that I cannot cross.
<Page9>
"You think I could joke about something like this?
I don't want to die either. Just hear me out. If you
rest until tonight, could you defeat Vlov if you had
the help of my eyes?"
<Page10>
She's the only one who can answer that question.
So... if she says that it's possible, then I'll bet it
all on that chance.
<Page11>
"Let's see... If you move exactly the way I tell you
to, then I guess we'd have the upper hand.
Are you really sure about this though? It'd be much
safer to just wait three days, you know."
"I know. But this is as much as I can take. I can't
wait any longer."
<Page12>
"Hmm... well, if you say so.
It's honestly pretty unlikely that we'd be able to
avoid him for three days anyway."
<Page13>
"So I guess from here on, this is a strategy meeting.
Where do you want to fight, Shiki?"
"Huh? Wait, hold on... are you really okay with this?"
<Page14>
I couldn't help but seek confirmation.
I didn't think that Arcueid――someone who takes battle
seriously――would listen to my request so readily.
<Page15>
"Like I said, if  say so.
Either we stay on the run for three days, or we find
and kill Vlov tonight.
Both options have the same chance of success. The only
difference is how likely you are to make it out alive."
<Page16>
"I see... Thank you, Arcueid."
"I'd advise against it though.
You really are a mystery, Shiki."
<Page17>
I've intentionally reduced my own chances of defeating
Vlov.
It's only natural that Arcueid wouldn't understand;
she's someone who values efficiency and certainty.
But even so, she didn't veto my idea.
<Page18>
I wonder if it's because she respects my feelings, or
if it's because the odds wouldn't change either way.
Well, in any case, I'm grateful that she's on board at
least.
