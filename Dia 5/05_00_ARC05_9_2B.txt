<Page1>
I stoop down in front of Arcueid.
I put my hands and knees on the earth.
<Page2>
An invisible arm runs through the ground.
Arcueid transforms the terrain into fine rubble like
before―――no, the scale this time is  greater.
<Page3>
The earth itself erupted. You'd be forgiven for
thinking a bomb had gone off.
The power of an overwhelming number of fragments. If
Vlov's cold air is like a blizzard, then what Arcueid
did is like an earth tsunami.
<Page4>
A flying ice spear is nothing more than a droplet of
water before this wall of earth and sand.
The mass, 50 meters tall and weighing 7000 tons, bears
down on Vlov as if to swallow him whole.
<Page5>
And yet, even in the face of this natural disaster that
has turned the earth's surface inside out, the knight
doesn't budge.
The billow of earth is driven back by a single thrust
from his steel lance.
<Page6>
Vlov must have seen through the downpour of debris.
He must have seen Arcueid fall to her knees after using
the last of her strength to upend that bedrock, and
concluded that the 'threat' supposedly lurking behind
this smokescreen was nowhere to be found.
<Page7>
In the face of the towering wave, the man manages to
regain his lapsed sense of reason.
No, he regained it two minutes ago to be exact.
His mind, which should have lost all sanity from the
constant barrage of cold, has been trying to function
normally ever since that moment――the moment he jumped
away from the human closing in on him.
<Page8>

'        .'
Vestiges of the time when he was normal.
His battle experience as a knight, forged in the Dark
Ages, has pushed aside the curse that bound him hand
and foot.
The pride and dignity of a mere twenty years,
triumphant over the madness that transcends thousands.
<Page9>
He knows well what kind of miracle this is.
Moments like this come and go. Nothing more than a
trick of the imagination before killing that human.
Simply a dream of an afterlife that will never come.
Never indulge yourself during combat―――such
human-like joy will freeze over in a matter of seconds.
<Page10>
"――――――."
That's why he cannot help but be inflamed by this turn
of events.
The enemy's aim is clear.
They will approach using the wall of debris as a
shield.
Their weapon is cutting. Even this wall is like a door
to them. They will surely cut it and intrude into this
space.
<Page11>
The lance is readied.
He knows that, by all rights, he ought to crush this
wave along with the enemies concealed behind it.
<Page12>
There is no need to respond to the enemy's tactics.
His strategy is to crush it all.
There is still plenty of power left in him.
The man has ten people's worth of the finest blood in
stock.
However―――
<Page13>
"That... I cannot do. No matter what... these souls are
the only ones I can never... consume."
They are his warmth. This blood, the fuel for his fire,
he will preserve for all eternity.
<Page14>
He didn't mean to look down on the human.
That thing was an exception evading description. He
already understood that.
The man had a feeling the second that thing got close,
it would all be over for him.
But even so, there are some things on which he cannot
compromise.
<Page15>
"―――Shatter―――!"
Thinking that it might be too late, he throws half of
his remaining strength into his lance.
<Page16>
The huge wave of debris collides and scatters.
It was not enough. The only thing pierced was the
object in front of him.
That was just a blow to ensure his own safety. The
enemy could not possibly be hit by such an attack.
He will definitely come. He will appear no matter the
cost.
<Page17>
"But―――"
As sad as it is, that is the limit of humanity.
A human cannot pass through a shower of debris on his
own.
He cannot even make use of the support of the Princess
of the True Ancestors to that end.
<Page18>
It will all be over when the downpour comes to an end.
As long as he can see the man's figure, he will never
allow such a surprise attack aga―――
<Page19>
"――――――"
The man's eyes widen as the vast expanse in front of
him comes into view.
―――Nothing. There isn't a single trace of him
anywhere.
<Page20>
Not even his shadow running away.
Perhaps he died from the blow of the lance? Impossible.
The man scolds himself for raising such a foolish
question.
A chill of death runs down his spine, stronger than
anything before.
<Page21>
For a mere second, the man's thoughts had drifted away
from the 'enemy'.
It's obvious that they're drawing near.
If the enemy cannot be located, then there must be some
mistake in his assumptions.
He predicted that the wall of debris would be used as a
shield.
However, if it wasn't used as a shield―――
<Page22>
"――――――Then it must be a road!"
The man looks up to the sky. To the enemy's figure
outlined by moonlight.
And there, burning blue like a will-o'-the-wisp, the
Mystic Eyes of Death Perception.
<Page23>
The debris that consumed Vlov wasn't the only thing
that Arcueid had sent flying.
This bedrock was the true objective.
She tied me down and blasted me out of his field of
view, to a place unaffected by his cryogenic influence.
<Page24>
On the ground, thirty meters below, the tsunami of
earth and sand is crushed.
Me and him. The final empty space between us.
I reaffirm my choices, along with their consequences.
<Page25>
If this is successful, I, Tohno Shiki, will lose both
of my legs.
Even if I survive this, I'll never walk again.
I imagine that sort of future in great detail.
―――I don't mind. In exchange for these two seconds,
it's a price I'll happily pay.
<Page26>
A mere second to locate the enemy.
I have to respect his perceptiveness, but with that
second, it's already too late.
<Page27>
"Huh? But wouldn't that mean you'll fall down halfway?
I can't really do anything to avoid that."
"Of course I'm going to fall! That's why―――"
<Page28>
"―――I need you to create a path for me."
<Page29>
The soaring bedrock comes together like a jigsaw
puzzle.
A hastily constructed runway lashed together by ivy.
Aside from the difference in altitude, both of us now
exist at the same coordinates in space.
<Page30>
"―――Now then."
I estimate the average chance of survival.
Before I begin, I give it 1% odds.
The route is set.
A one-way road spanning thirty meters in a mere two
seconds.
"It's showtime, vampire."
<Page31>
The gliding descent begins.
A short slide―――toward death itself.
<Page32>
I've completely given up on responding to him at this
point.
At the speed my brain is operating at, I'm only capable
of making one decision per second.
With only two seconds before I fall, I focus all my
abilities on just two points.
<Page33>
The decision I made will bring me face to face with
death at every turn.
But even amongst those brushes with death, there will
be moments that push more perilously close than others.
Cases where I may not be able to survive no matter what
I do.
<Page34>
I've identified two such critical moments.
Excluding those, the survival rate is probably around
10%. I can work with those odds; I'll ignore the
favorable cases for now.
<Page35>
The problem is those cases with a 0% chance of success.
Against those odds, no matter your abilities as a
human, your death is a foregone conclusion.
So I'll give it everything I've got, and drag that 0%
chance up to 1%.
<Page36>
In order to overcome those two fatal scenarios, I steel
myself.
I have no mental capacity left to allocate to any other
eventualities.
So now that I've started to descend, I don't have the
ability to think about how to respond to him.
<Page37>
What if I have to handle more than just two of those
do-or-die moments in that period?
I do not consider that. I don't have the capacity to
overcome three 'deaths' in my mind. If that's how it
plays out, victory is his. It would just mean that his
power is stronger than I can imagine.
<Page38>
A dense flurry of ice spears shoots toward the falling
prey.
It's like the jaws of a beast. It's terrifying, but it
doesn't matter.
I wonder if it's thanks to his instincts that he
anticipated this.
Convinced that I would come for him, and terrified that
I would kill him when I did...
<Page39>
―――Ten meters.
The first chance for failure.
The sensations of my limbs, the fine-tuning of my
muscles, and the sudden braking of my torso return.
After witnessing that angle of fire, I alter the
natural course of my trajectory...!
<Page40>
A lump of iron passes right next to me.
My gamble on that '0%' chance paid off.
One second left. Victory is mine. He is already out of
options.
<Page41>
My second critical decision will be 'that moment'.
I'll parry the impact of this fall, and before my body
shatters, I'll kill him.
I don't know what will happen after that. I'll just
focus my undivided attention on cutting his 'lines'.
<Page42>
That's why.
If he makes one more move than I predict...
<Page43>
"――――――"
I won't think. I won't even dodge. Even if I could
change the situation halfway through, I wouldn't bother
with something so pointless.
That's why I gave up thinking.
If I'm going to die, then I was dead from the moment I
started gliding.
This is fine.
I'm sure that if he skewered my brain here, I wouldn't
even notice.
<Page44>
―――The second chance for failure.
The extreme -100℃ conditions bring my entire body to a
halt.
My instinct to prepare for landing―――
And the reasoning necessary to advocate for the
significance of life have already been left behind with
the night sky.
<Page45>
"Vlov...!"
I transfer the kinetic energy from my thighs to my
waist, from my waist to my back muscles, and from my
back muscles to the swing of the knife in my right
hand.
My muscles no longer try to hold me back.
I am a killing machine that works on raw sensory input
alone. The only thing I need to focus on is capturing
the lines.
<Page46>
I see a light around the periphery of his focality.
The whirling will of atoms. The predetermined lifespan
of matter.
The pit-like point of death.
<Page47>
Having abandoned all thought, I understand through
instinct.
If lines represent the death of life, then that point
represents the death of existence.
Any immortal being, any monster, can be 'killed' with a
single strike. It is none other than the end of the
universe, the most repulsive thing in the world.
<Page48>
But I really don't care about that discovery.
My whole body shakes with a feeling far stronger than
that.
<Page49>
A machete is grasped in Vlov's hand. Even after
unleashing his giant, deadly lance, this vampire was
convinced that I was coming and chose to intercept me.
At this stage. Against an opponent like me who fights
dirty.
<Page50>
"――――――"
This guy is the real deal. I don't know how he stacks
up as a vampire. I don't care to know. But simply as a
murderer? He is extraordinary.
<Page51>
I can't help but hate him.
If he was in his right mind and wasn't a vampire, he
would've been a knight to be envied.
Even if I can see no shadow of that past self now.
<Page52>
That weapon will never have a chance to reach me.
Turning, dodging, and twisting.
My eyes spot a line along his center.
<Page53>
In an instant, the atmosphere reverts back to its
original temperature.
The cold wave, far removed from any natural phenomenon,
disappears along with the man's life.
In the middle of it all―――
"―――What... is this?"
The vampire muses to himself as he sways.
<Page54>
"I do not know this wound... I cannot remember this
loss.
This―――indescribable feeling of the air on my
skin... is something I lost some time ago."
<Page55>
I don't know what he's talking about―――
Or which country's language he's speaking in.
But his gentle voice calls to mind a poet celebrating
the spring.
<Page56>
"Ah―――I feel no pain, nor do I feel the cold waves.
It is terrifying but familiar.
Almost as though I have become a dead man."
