...Of course, it's my sister Akiha.
<Page2>
She apparently came to visit me a few times right after
I was entrusted to the Arima household.
Unfortunately, I didn't get to see her since I was
always on my way to and from the hospital. After she
went off to a boarding school, we only exchanged a few
letters.
<Page3>
Unlike Akiha, I'm no longer a member of the main
family.
That was why I was able to lead a free and easy life.
It wouldn't be inaccurate to say I've barely had any
contact with my sister at all these past seven years.
<Page4>
To be honest, the idea of returning to the Tohno
mansion hadn't even crossed my mind the entire time.
But Akiha is there.
When we were kids―――
Akiha was quiet, and always followed me around as
though there was something out there that terrified
her.
<Page5>
Perhaps it was her long black hair and luxurious
clothes, but Akiha seemed like a captive princess
straight out of a fairy tale. A fragile girl.
Even though I have no right to act like a big brother
now, I've been worried about Akiha's future these past
seven years.
<Page6>
So―――when I heard the news of Makihisa's death, my
first concern was for her.
<Page7>
In that vast mansion without Father, she was left
alone.
More than anything, I feel guilty about forcing the
duties of the Tohno family on her and living a selfish
life.
I think the reason why I agreed to come back to the
mansion may have been so I could apologize to her.
