I walk to school a little slower than usual.
By the time I see the main gate, it's almost seven
o'clock.
Students on their way to club activities are hurrying
past the main gate.
They must be trying to use up the limited time they
have until eight o'clock, the start of homeroom.
<Page2>
Tokyo Metropolitan Souya High School.
This year marks the fortieth anniversary of the old
school's founding.
It's a totally unremarkable high school with a moderate
rate of advancement, passable extracurricular
activities, and reasonably lax school rules.
<Page3>
The only complaint from the male students is a very
common one: 'Please improve the outdated uniform
design'. Our requests have been completely ignored.
On the other hand, the female students' uniform was
changed three years ago.
The school thought that people would be hesitant to
apply if they had to wear the old-fashioned sailor
uniforms, so they did the best they could to
compromise.
<Page4>
"Hmm...?"
The scenery is familiar, but something feels amiss.
Everyone seems more hectic this morning.
<Page5>
Teachers are running to the staff room with pale faces.
An unfamiliar black car is stationed in the parking
lot.
The sky is bleak.
I find myself imagining a funeral with no attendees, or
a somber funerary curtain stretching on and on into the
distance...
<Page6>
I sigh at my dark thoughts.
I decide to shake off my unpleasant premonition and
head to the classroom.
<Page7>
I enter the empty classroom.
I sit down in my chair and kill time until the morning
homeroom.
As I studiously dedicate myself to my prep work, the
classroom begins to fill with people.
<Page8>
"Good morning. Today's morning practice is over."
"Huh, I'm not the first one here? You're pretty fast,
Tohno."
"Oh, that's right, volunteering!"
"Was that today? Shit, did I accidentally skip?!!"
<Page9>
The students in class 2-C get along better than most.
They greet each other cheerfully as they see one
another, before taking their seats.
<Page10>
I have a chat with the students that have just come
back from club activities.
We cover everything ranging from last night's news,
which has been so thoroughly discussed there's barely
anything left to say about it, to school gossip that's
less than ten minutes old.
<Page11>
It might just be simple idle talk to kill time, but
it's a necessary part of our routine.
It's a light warm-up before the day begins.
In this age of information overload, it would be
exhausting for everyone involved if we only engaged in
serious dialogue all the time.
<Page12>
The atmosphere in the classroom suddenly changes.
The harmonious chatter is replaced by furtive
whispering.
<Page13>
"Hey, don't block the road, assholes!
It's early in the morning and you're already clustered
up, blocking the way."
A prickly and standoffish complaint echoes through the
classroom.
I know who it is without having to look. The guy that's
just shown up, the one responsible for casting a shadow
over the classroom―――
<Page14>
"Sup! Good mornin' four-eyes!
Man, do you ever  look like a downer? You really are
a piece of shit!"
"........."
―――is this delinquent, who long ago strayed from the
idyllic spirit of our school.
<Page15>
"Hey, where's my greeting?
Someone went out of their way to see you this morning,
and you won't even say hello? Don't you have any words
to thank me for gracing you with my presence?"
<Page16>
"No, I don't. The only words I have are about how fed
up I am seeing your dumb mug this early in the morning.
Besides, I have no reason to thank you. I don't go to
school for you."
<Page17>
"What? Don't be ridiculous! I only ever go to school
for you! Isn't that unfair?!"
"......"
I'm speechless.
Sometimes I wonder why I'm his best friend.
<Page18>
Orange dyed hair and pierced ears.
The mean look in his eyes and his rebellious attire
give the impression of someone who's always spoiling
for a fight.
In this day and age where the culture of delinquent
students has died out, he's a free-spirited purveyor of
violence.
That's him, Inui Arihiko.
<Page19>
"Well, okay. At least you're doing something good by
coming to class in the morning.
Good morning, Arihiko. Are you finally starting to care
about your attendance?"
<Page20>
"Nah, I'm not worried about that. I can still afford to
skip now and then.# It's just, I've got my sister at
home today, so I can't slack off.
Besides, I've been staying up all night playing mahjong
and I'm at the end of my rope."
"I see. My bad, let me redo my greeting.
Good night, Assihiko. Hurry back to your desk and get
some sleep."
<Page21>
"Come on, what a cold reaction.
That's your attitude toward your rival from middle
school? Couldn't you be more passionate about it!?"
<Page22>
"Why do you and I have to be rivals...?
If you want to live an unprincipled life, find some
like-minded people on the street. Don't drag me into
it."
No, I've lent him almost 10,000 yen since middle school
and he hasn't given any of it back. That's not a rival
anymore, that's just a normal enemy.
<Page23>
"I don't get why you only act this coldly toward me.
You're like a saint to everyone else, isn't that
unfair?"
"See, you do get it.
There's nothing fair about the world."
<Page24>
"That's true...
But aren't you especially cold to me?"
<Page25>
Arihiko sighs exaggeratedly.
It's not like I'm being cold to him on purpose, it's
just a natural consequence of how frank we are with
each other.
Although our interests and tastes are different, we're
on the same wavelength somehow, I guess.
<Page26>
"Anyway... I get you wanted to get away from home and
all...
But to think that a night owl like you would attend
class so early in the morning, hell really has frozen
over.
It's a little, no,  unusual."
<Page27>
"Yeah, I guess so.
Waking up isn't enough reason on its own to come to
school. Maaan, I wanna go home. Studying is something
you really need to want to do, huh."
<Page28>
He's certainly right, but when this guy says it, it
makes me think that simply coming to school despite not
feeling up to it is admirable.
<Page29>
"Save that chatter for the guy you see in the mirror.
What I want to know is why you didn't just go to the
city. Wouldn't karaoke or a manga cafe be a better way
to kill time?"
"That's the thing. It's getting real dangerous out
there these days.
Fighting my way around out there ain't free, I only
show my face when I have the energy for it."
<Page30>
"Dangerous...?"
"Oh? I thought you knew, you know, about .
I'm talking about the spree killings that have been
causing a stir recently. There are even cops patrolling
around the area in front of the station at night now."
"Oh yeah, I think I heard something like that."
<Page31>
Hearing about it from Arihiko has jogged my memory.
The house I lived in until yesterday is a few stations
away from here, so I hadn't really been paying much
attention to events surrounding Souya Station.
Pretty sure it was all over the news though.
If I recall correctly―――
<Page32>
"What were they calling him again? Sounded like some
kind of vulgar tabloid headline...
The Midnight Spree Killer, was it?"
<Page33>
"A series of bizarre murders. The victims were usually
young women, and the dead body they discovered two days
ago was the eighth. All of them had cross-shaped wounds
on their throats, too."
What the hell?
It's so bizarre I can't even picture it.
<Page34>
"That's wrong, Inui-kun. All the victims had lost a
significant amount of blood."
<Page35>
We must have been talking pretty loudly, because
Yumizuka pops in from nearby to correct him.
<Page36>
"Ah, right, right. The headlines were all like 'the
Modern Vampire', that's it.
Thanks, Yumizuka, mornin'!"
<Page37>
"Good morning to you too, Inui-kun.
Oh, also, the trauma varies from person to person, with
some having no wounds at all whereas others have really
severe injuries... or so I heard."
<Page38>
"You know a lot about it, don't you, Yumizuka-san?"
"N-Not really!
This case is happening right in our city after all, if
you watch the news, you're bound to remember it!"
<Page39>
"Well, that's how it is, Tohno.
Even for me, there's no way I'd be hangin' out at night
while there's a serial killer around. I've been quietly
spending my late nights at home these days."
<Page40>
"Oh, so that's your reason?
I'm surprised you're so reasonable. It's not like you
to stay at home, scared of a murderer."
<Page41>
"It's not that strange, most people are scared of
murderers.
Having to contend with someone who's all out for blood
while you're just minding your own business is not my
idea of a fight. That's just an ambush. Hell no to
that. I ain't throwin' away my life just yet."
"Oh... I see. You're right, if you're targeted, you'll
have to fight to the bitter end."
<Page42>
"Come on, man. Don't I even get the choice to run away?
Why would I have to fight to the death?"
"What? Escape isn't an option in that scenario, right?"
<Page43>
"Right, I was an idiot for bringing this up with you.
Though to be honest, I don't care about the murderer
either. They're like a natural disaster, right? If you
run into one, well, that's just the hand you've been
dealt.
My reason for not going out into the city is more
practical. Lately, there've been a bunch of new idiots
in front of the north gate. To be honest, I don't even
wanna see their faces."
<Page44>
In front of the north gate... that's downtown opposite
the business district. At night, it's bustling with
lots of people and traffic.
Arihiko also lives near the north gate, so if he's
avoiding these 'new idiots', they must be a pretty
dangerous group indeed.
<Page45>
"Haven't you heard about it?
That thing that sounds kinda like a test of courage: go
into an underground passage through a secret entrance,
and if you make it to the end, you win a lot of money."
<Page46>
"I've heard of that too, but... isn't it just a ghost
story?"
<Page47>
"Well, it's been an urban legend for a long time.
Those idiots have gone in and tried to turn it into
some kind of scam. I don't know where they came from,
but there's a terrible atmosphere by the north gate
now. The slightest thing can kick off a fistfight."
<Page48>
"Basically, I don't wanna get hurt, y'know? If they
keep being so brazen, the police will step in soon.
I'll just play it safe and stay indoors for a while
until they've been caught."
<Page49>
The urban legend of the north gate... I'm no local, so
I can't say I've ever heard of it.
I guess that's something else I'll have to start paying
attention to starting today...
<Page50>
"Hey, what's with the lack of response?
It happen again? You collapse from anemia this morning
or something?"
<Page51>
"No, I'm fine.
It's nice of you to worry about me, but if I were
anemic 24/7 my body would have withered away by now."
"Yeah, I guess you're right. If you say you're okay,
then you must be okay."
<Page52>
"Come on, class is about to start. Get back to your
seat and go to sleep."
"Right... Oh, yeah. For today's lunch, I'll be in the
cafeteria. I've invited a special guest to surprise
you, so look forward to it."
<Page53>
Arihiko snickers, as though plotting something, and
returns to his seat.
<Page54>
"See you later, Tohno-kun."
"Ah, yes. Thanks for keeping us company, Yumizuka-san."
With quick, light steps, Yumizuka returns to her seat.
<Page55>
Five minutes after the bell signaling the start of
homeroom, our teacher, Toyama-sensei, still hasn't
arrived.
Just as homeroom is about to end, the teacher next door
comes in and announces that Toyama-sensei is absent.
<Page56>
"Woohoo! Today's math class is self-study!"
Someone in the class shouts in victory.
<Page57>
Toyama-sensei is our math teacher.
If she's not here, today's class will be self-study. So
long as we complete the assigned printouts, we can
spend the rest of the period as we please.
Some students use it to study, some to play.
<Page58>
I start to work on my math problems.
When I was a child, I was told that it would be
difficult for me to enter a prestigious school with my
body, so I stopped attending cram school, but studying
itself was still interesting.
It doesn't hurt to have a good education, regardless of
whether you go on to college or enter the workforce.
After solving a few application problems, I look up and
notice some students in the hallway.
<Page59>
Since my seat is far away, I can only hear fragments of
their voices.
<Page60>
"I knew it..."
#"I can't believe it..."
"During morning practice, the teachers turned pale when
they entered the staff room..."
"It's still just a rumor."
#"But for it to happen so easily..."
"That's terrible, how did that happen?"
I furrow my brow, thinking that the worse my
premonition is, the more likely it is to come true.
<Page61>
"Yesterday's incident."
#"There were two guys in the principal's office who
looked like detectives."
I brace myself for what's coming next.
It's something I'm used to, but I breathe in and wait
for the words so that I don't dismiss it as something
natural.
<Page62>
"Like I said... Apparently Toyama died last night."
I close my eyelids gently as if blocking out my
headache.
<Page63>
The rumors about Toyama-sensei didn't spread very far,
and our morning classes end without incident.
<Page64>
It's lunchtime, and the classroom is bustling.
Some are in the cafeteria, some are in the courtyard,
and some are still in their classrooms spreading out
their lunches.
Now, where should I have lunch?
C:> I'll meet up with Arihiko at the cafeteria.
C:> I'll stay in the classroom and see what happens.
C:> I'll figure it out in the hallway.
