Unfortunately, I don't have anything to talk to her
about.
She keeps on smiling, not seeming to mind the fact that
I'm at a loss for words.

"Um... do you go to school by train, Senpai?"
"Well, yes. I use it when I have to.
What about you, Tohno-kun? Is your house far from
here?"
<Page3>
"Yeah, it's pretty far. I get on at the end of the
line.
But, that's in the past now. Today's the last time I
take the train to school."
"Oh. Are you moving?"
"........."
<Page4>
I can't think of a good way to explain it, so I just
hand-wave the details.
My gaze drifts over to the window and I look out at the
view of the city.
Ciel-senpai must have picked up on the fact that I
found the topic a little difficult to discuss because
she graciously refrains from prying further.
<Page5>
Our mundane conversation carries on for fifteen
minutes.
Before long, the train arrives at our destination:
Souya Station.
<Page6>
It's just before seven o'clock.
It's a little early for school, and the city is still
asleep. The area in front of the station is quiet now,
but in an hour, it'll be full of people and cars.

"I guess we'll part ways here.
Thanks for keeping me company. If you see me at school,
please don't hesitate to say hello, okay?"
<Page8>
Waving her hands with a smile, Senpai runs off.
She's so lively that I feel like running as well, but
I'm not in any particular rush.
<Page9>
I have my health to worry about, so I decide to go to
school at my normal pace.
