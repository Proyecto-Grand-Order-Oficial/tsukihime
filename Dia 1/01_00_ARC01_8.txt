I head out onto to the second floor lobby.
The Tohno residence is divided into an east wing and a
west wing with the lobby at its center.
<Page2>
If I were to give an analogy, it would be like a bird
with its wings spread.
The lobby is the body of the bird, and the east and
west parts are the wings.
One wing... is about the size of a small clinic.
It's symmetrical, and I seem to recall that the east
and west wings have the same number of rooms.
<Page3>
"Shiki-sama, your room is this way."
<Page4>
Hisui doesn't head for the stairs, but a corridor that
leads from the lobby toward the west wing.
Looks like my room is on the second floor.
<Page5>
The sun has already set outside.
A blue carpet# stretches across the corridor.
The white walls are reminiscent of castle ramparts.
Down this endless corridor of warm orange lights walks
a girl in a maid uniform.
<Page6>
"...It's like a fairyland."
My thoughts couldn't help but spill out of my mouth.
<Page7>
"Shiki-sama, do you have any questions...?"
"No, I'm just talking to myself, don't worry about it."
"........."
Hisui looks at me, bows, and continues walking.
<Page8>
"........."
...I'm speechless.
I wonder how many times I've been left at a loss for
words since I arrived here.
<Page9>
The floor is made of teak, which is considered a
high-grade wood.
The ceiling's gotta be at least three meters high.
I think I can see a private sunroom over in the back.
The room that Hisui leads me to isn't the sort of room
a high school student would usually live in, not by any
stretch of the imagination.
<Page10>
"...Is this my room?"
"Yes. If you are dissatisfied, I can arrange a
different room for you."
<Page11>
"No, I'm not dissatisfied, but it's―――"
I think it's a bit too good for me.
<Page12>
"Shiki-sama?"
"It's okay, it's nothing.
I'll be happy to use this room."
<Page13>
"Yes. The room has not been altered in seven years, so
I believe it should still serve your needs."
"......"
Wait, in other words...
<Page14>
"...Hold on a minute.
This used to be my room seven years ago?"
"That is what I have been told. Is it not?"
<Page15>
Hisui tilts her head faintly.
...I'm glad.
It seems like she can at least show  emotion.
<Page16>
"Hmm... well, now that you mention it, yeah.
I remember bits and pieces of it, so I guess it must've
been."
<Page17>
This room doesn't feel familiar at all, but maybe
that's what happens when you've been away for seven
years.
<Page18>
"I still feel uncomfortable, though. I've been living
in a four-and-a-half-mat room until this morning, so
it's like I've come to stay in a fancy hotel."
<Page19>
"I understand how you feel, but please get accustomed
to it.
After all, you are the eldest son of the Tohno family
from today onwards."
"...Well, yeah, that's true. I'll try my best to at
least keep up appearances."
<Page20>
I put my bag on the desk and straighten my back.
It's going to be nerve-wracking, but I'll just have to
get used to it.
I need to be able to relax in this room, if nowhere
else.
<Page21>
"Additionally, all the luggage that arrived last night
has been brought in, do you find any issues with it?"
"No, not really.
Oh, is there something I'm not allowed to bring in?"
<Page22>
"...No, you simply had a surprisingly small amount of
luggage.
If there is anything you need, I can prepare it for
you, so please let me know."
<Page23>
"...I see. No, I don't really need anything for now.
I don't have much luggage to begin with. The only
things I brought were my bag, these glasses, and..."
<Page24>
Inside my bag there's just my textbooks, other than
that there's the white ribbon I've been holding onto
for a long time now, but that's about it.
<Page25>
"Anyway, don't worry about my luggage.
A nice room like this is more than enough."
"...Understood.
In that case, I will call on you again in an hour."
<Page26>
"An hour from now, you mean for dinner?"
"Yes. Until then, please make yourself at home."
<Page27>
As expected, she says it expressionlessly.
But, how do I pass the time here?
<Page28>
It's only six o'clock in the evening.
Normally, I would be in the living room watching TV or
using my phone, but I seriously doubt that this house
has a 'casual gathering space'.
<Page29>
"Hisui, let me ask you a trivial question.
Does this mansion have a television or Wi-Fi?"
<Page30>
"A television or Wi-Fi...?"
<Page31>
She narrows her eyes faintly.
...I'd wanted to scope out the situation, but this line
of questioning might be more trouble than it's worth.
It seems wrong to ask whether there is basic modern
entertainment in such a luxurious Western-style
building.
<Page32>
"...There are no such things in the living room. There
is an entertainment room in the west wing, but it is
locked.
The relatives who stayed here until the other day
brought their personal belongings, but they took
everything with them when they left, so there is
nothing left."
<Page33>
"The relatives that Akiha kicked out... Who was staying
there and for how long?"
<Page34>
"Kugamine-sama's eldest son and his family occupied
three rooms in the west wing on the first floor.
Touzaki-sama's third daughter along with her fiance
occupied a corner room in the west wing on the second
floor.
Kishima-sama's eldest son took a room in the east wing
on the first floor.
They all lived here for about three years.
Other than that... I heard that the family doctor of
the previous head, Makihisa-sama, was staying at the
mansion."
<Page35>
"For three years? ...Hey, Hisui, weren't they more like
freeloaders than guests then?"
<Page36>
She doesn't reply.
It seems that no matter what kind of people are staying
here, as a servant, she can't give her personal
opinion.
<Page37>
Anyway, it seems like the people who were staying here
have moved out with their belongings. In that case, I'd
better not expect that they left any souvenirs behind.
It's unlikely that Makihisa, who was prejudiced against
vulgar things like modern entertainment, would have
allowed people to watch TV and browse the internet
freely.
The same goes for Akiha, who was disciplined by him.
<Page38>
"―――Well, it's not like I'm going to die without
it."
And I have my phone anyway.
I take it out of my pocket and check the time and
reception.
<Page39>
As a matter of fact, there is still signal here.
It's only one bar, but I'm relieved to still have the
internet as a lifeline.
...For some reason, I'd felt it would be natural for
there to be no service in such an unrealistic mansion.
<Page40>
"........."
Hisui has remained silent this entire time.
The epitome of a servant, she does not say anything
except what is necessary and what is asked of her.
<Page41>
As someone not used to having a maid, I feel
uncomfortable with her acting like this.
I'd like to somehow make her laugh, but it seems like
it'd be difficult to do so with a half-hearted effort.
<Page42>
"There's a library in the west wing of the first floor,
right?
I'll see what I can find there when I'm free."
<Page43>
She doesn't reply.
Her gaze, which was fixed on me, shifts slightly, as if
she's staring into the empty space above. Like a cat.
<Page44>
"―――Hisui?"
Hisui doesn't say anything.
And then, suddenly, she looks straight back at me.
<Page45>
"I think it is in Nee-san's room."
"What?"
...I raise my voice abruptly...
Well, I mean, it's...
<Page46>
"I was talking about the TV.
I remember seeing it in Nee-san's room once."
Hisui says as if recalling the events of a few years
ago.
<Page47>
"Good, there's at least that much here... wait a
minute.
When you say 'Nee-san', do you mean Kohaku-san by any
chance?"
<Page48>
"Yes. Nee-san and I are the only two people currently
working in this mansion."
<Page49>
...Now that I think about it, they look very much
alike.
Compared to the girl in the kimono, who was smiling the
whole time, the girl in the maid uniform is so
expressionless that I didn't even make the connection
that the two were sisters.
<Page50>
"I see. She definitely looks like the kind of person
who would watch a variety show."
However, I don't feel comfortable going to her room and
asking her to let me watch TV.
<Page51>
"Sorry, please pretend that I never asked this
question.
I'm going to live here from now on, so I have to follow
the rules of this mansion anyway."
<Page52>
Besides, I can't imagine what kind of sarcastic remarks
Akiha would make if I were to leisurely watch TV on the
day I came back.
I'll become a hard-working student, as expected of a
member of the Tohno family.
<Page53>
"I'll stay in my room until dinner, so please call me
when it's time. You have other things to do, don't
you?"
<Page54>
Hisui nods in affirmation and puts her hand on the
doorknob.
The door swings open with a faint creak.
She bows, then quietly leaves the room.
