―――I'll stay in the classroom and see what happens.
What can I say? I'm too lazy to even get up.
I'm hungry, and I know I need to eat, but I just don't
feel like having anything right now.
<Page2>
I seem to remember Arihiko mentioning something
earlier, but I'm not in the mood.
All I want to do right now is sink deep into my chair
and take a breather.
<Page3>
"Ah, good, you're still in class."
"Hm?"
I hear an unexpected voice nearby.
I turn around to see if they were talking to me.
<Page4>
"Looks like you didn't go to the cafeteria with
Inui-kun after all.
I almost went there looking for you."
"I don't have much of an appetite.
That aside, did something happen, Yumizuka-san? If
you're talking to me about it, it must be pretty
serious."
<Page5>
I'm not really a friend of Yumizuka's, just a
classmate.
She may have joined in when I was chatting with Arihiko
this morning, but it's rare for her to talk to me one
on one like this.
I feel it's reasonable for me to assume that she has
some urgent business that she needs me for.
<Page6>
"W-Well, it's no surprise that you would think that,
with the way I've been until now..."
Yumizuka looks away awkwardly.
It's only a momentary lull though, and she quickly
returns to her normal cheerful expression.
<Page7>
"Habano-sensei was looking for you. He said he wanted
to talk to you about your place of residence."
"My place of residence? What, is this about my move?"
<Page8>
Habano-sensei is the head teacher of the second-years.
Since Toyama-sensei is absent, I guess this now falls
to him instead.
<Page9>
"Thanks, I'll head right over.
But... that's weird. I completed the procedures to
change my address yesterday."
<Page10>
"―――――"
I force my sluggish body to stand up.
Yumizuka stares at me motionlessly.
<Page11>
"Is there anything else?"
"Huh? N-No, there's nothing else, really!"
"......"
I wonder if Yumizuka is feeling sick as well.
<Page12>
At this point, Yumizuka Satsuki is one of the central
figures in our class.
She's cheerful, easy to get along with, hardworking,
and it's clear that she cares more about those around
her than herself.
<Page13>
I think most of the boys like her, and there are no bad
rumors about her among the girls.
Naturally, there's always a crowd of people surrounding
her.
She is a well-liked mood-setter, the polar opposite of
my unsociable self.
<Page14>
Although we're in the same second-year class, we've
only exchanged a few words.
To be honest, I'm surprised she even remembers my name.
<Page15>
"Tohno-kun. I was wondering if I could ask you
something."
"Sure. What?"
<Page16>
"Sorry if this is a weird question...
You just said you're moving, but are you going
somewhere else, Tohno-kun? Are you transferring to
another school?"
<Page17>
"―――Ah."
When she asked that question, I understood.
Her confusion is understandable, but her question is
off the mark.
<Page18>
"No, it's just a change of address. I'm only moving to
Souya. It's not a big change.
This is a good school, I wouldn't want to transfer
out."
<Page19>
"Y-Yeah, that's right! We had a tough entrance exam! I
studied really hard for it!"
R-Right.
Although, I wouldn't have thought someone like Yumizuka
would find this school particularly challenging.
<Page20>
"Oh. But Tohno-kun, if you're changing addresses, does
that mean you're leaving the Arimas?"
"Yeah, that's right. It's a shame I have to leave, but
I can't stay in their care forever―――"
<Page21>
No, wait a minute.
I'm positive that Arihiko is the only person who knows
that I've been living with the Arima family.
<Page22>
"I'm sorry. Did I ever talk to you about this?"
"Yeah, you told me all about it. It was a long time
ago, though."
"―――I see. I don't know what to say about
that―――"
<Page23>
I must have had nothing else to talk about.
I can't remember anything in particular, but if
Yumizuka and I were chatting like this in the past,
it's pretty plausible that I was struggling to keep the
conversation going and ended up mentioning it.
<Page24>
"Well, I'd better get going. Is Habano-sensei in the
staff room?"
"Yes, he said he would dock your points if you didn't
show up in ten minutes. I wonder what points he's
docking exactly..."
<Page25>
Yumizuka laughs awkwardly, with neither sarcasm nor
irony.
I can't help but laugh as well.
Our school head has a habit of threatening to dock our
points, but obviously these days 'poor conduct' doesn't
affect any part of our grading.
<Page26>
"By the way, what are you going to do for lunch?"
"I'll drop by the cafeteria on my way to the staff
room. Arihiko will be there, after all."
"I-I see. See you later, Tohno-kun."
Waving awkwardly, Yumizuka leaves for her usual group
of girls.
<Page27>
After answering Habano-sensei's... difficult questions
about my relationship with the Tohno family as
succinctly as I could, I go to the cafeteria.
<Page28>
The cafeteria is busy again today. Most of the tables
are occupied, if not full.
<Page29>
Only about a third of the students use the cafeteria,
and those who are worried about how much money they
have left in their wallets run to the cheaper school
store.
Arihiko and I sit down at a table, watching the other
students line up with meal tickets in their hands.
