After dinner, I return to my room.
It's now 9:30.
I spent a full two hours in the dining room.
<Page2>
"Welcome back, Shiki-sama. Although you did not
instruct me to do so, I have prepared your bed."
<Page3>
...She says.
Hisui was quietly making the bed in my room.
It seems like she returned slightly before me to get
things ready.
<Page4>
"Ah―――yes, thank you."
"As for your pajamas, please use the ones over there.
If you could put your clothes in the basket and leave
it out in the hallway, that would be very helpful."
<Page5>
A woven wicker basket is placed at the foot of the bed.
It seems that if I were to put my worn clothes into the
basket and leave it in the hallway, she'd take care of
the laundry.
...This feels more and more like being at a luxury
hotel.
<Page6>
"Do you have any questions?"
Hisui asks with a deadpan look on her face.
I have lots of questions, but I don't know anything
about Hisui and Kohaku-san at all.
<Page7>
"This isn't really relevant, but can I ask you
something?"
"Yes, what is it?"
"I'd like to know what kind of work you and Kohaku-san
do here, if you don't mind."
<Page8>
"I am responsible for attending to you, while my older
sister Kohaku attends to Lady Akiha. We are both in
charge of the mansion while you two are away, what
about it?"
"...Taking care, you say. That's what I thought."
<Page9>
I slump my shoulders in disappointment.
Akiha said it as if it was obvious, but I'm just an
ordinary high school student.
Having a girl around my own age look after me isn't to
my taste right now.
<Page10>
"...Does that mean you're my personal maid?"
"Yes. I will always be at your service."
Hisui bows deeply.
I feel a sharp pain in my chest, brought on by my own
selfish guilt.
<Page11>
"Alright. From the way Akiha puts it, she isn't gonna
leave me be. Besides, I don't think making her dismiss
you just to accommodate me is a good thing. So I'll
accept your help but―――"
<Page12>
"Do you have any special requests?"
"It's not that big of a deal... but um, 'Shiki-sama' is
a bit too much for me.
I'm not that kind of person, and to be honest, it's so
far above me that I feel like I've been grabbed by the
scruff of my neck."
<Page13>
"But, you are my master."
"You say that, but up until today I was living a normal
life.
To return here and immediately start being addressed
with '-sama' by a girl that's around my age... it's a
bit much."
'I see,' Hisui replies unenthusiastically.
<Page14>
"You can refer to me as Tohno-san or Shiki-san. I don't
want to be too formal.
Then, I'll refer to you as Hisui-san in return."
<Page15>
"........."
Hisui lowers her eyebrows expressionlessly and bites
her lips hard.
...Oh, man.
I wanted to make it easier for her, but it didn't work.
I've only made things more difficult.
<Page16>
"But, you are my employer."
"I'm not the one hiring you, am I?"
<Page17>
"...With all due respect, it is the same thing,
Shiki-sama.
I am a servant of the Tohno family. Whether it is the
head of the family or any of their relatives, it does
not change the fact that they are all revered as
masters.
Therefore, please only refer to me as Hisui if you can.
I hope you can understand the feelings of a servant who
is addressed with an honorific by the person she
serves."
<Page18>
"―――Mm."
...I can't argue with her when she says it like that.
From a servant's point of view, what she just said
makes complete sense.
<Page19>
".... You do things I can't do, so I'm the one who
should be thanking you..."
I'll only be causing her more trouble if I keep
insisting.
For now, I'll express my intentions as best I can.
<Page20>
"Should I call you Hisui then?"
"Yes, no matter what."
"...."
That was a sharper response from Hisui than I had
expected.
<Page21>
"Okay. I'll do that.
But please don't be too formal with me. I'd appreciate
it if you could let your sister, Kohaku-san, know about
this as well."
"Yes. If you say so, Shiki-sama."
<Page22>
Hisui bows her head.
―――Alright. We have a long way to go before we can
have a frank conversation.
<Page23>
Hisui bows and leaves the room.
As soon as I'm left alone, my fatigue hits me all at
once.
...Too much has happened since this morning.
My body is in desperate need of sleep.
<Page24>
I turn off the lights and lie down on the bed.
A narcotic desire to sleep.
My exhausted body drains the vitality from my limbs,
forcing me to fall asleep.
<Page25>
I keep my eyelids open to resist the temptation, but
it's futile.
No matter how much I don't want to sleep, I will
eventually fall asleep.
That's how the human body works.
<Page26>
...In between wakefulness and sleep, I gaze at the
ceiling in a daze.
<Page27>
...Coming home for the first time in seven years.
...Seeing my family for the first time in seven years.
...I almost feel as though it's someone else's home.
"――――But I'm back, aren't I?"
...I monologue in order to accept that fact.
<Page28>
...My consciousness sinks to depths from which there is
no turning back.
...A mansion on a hill where the bustle of the city
does not reach.
...An isolated island surrounded by tall trees.
...The moment I close my eyes, I finally come to
realize that it feels just like being in a prison.
