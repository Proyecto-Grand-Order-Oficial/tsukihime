I sit face to face with Akiha at the dinner table.
Hisui and Kohaku-san are fully focused on serving us.
A master and their servants cannot sit at the same
table.
...This may be obvious, but as someone used to living
with the Arimas――where the entire family ate together
around the same table――I find the setup a little
uncomfortable.
<Page2>
In addition, I've been letting my table manners
atrophy.
Humans are experts in optimization, and relegate unused
memories to a corner of the mind. Naturally, table
manners were one of the first things to go.
<Page3>
Seeing Akiha raise her eyebrows at every move I make
really keeps me on edge. Truth is――it's thrilling.
Honestly though, the thought of doing this every day is
really depressing...
<Page4>
Dinner ends without any conversation.
I was so busy trying to remember my table manners that
I didn't have time for any conversation.
And Akiha seemed to be completely displeased, as
expected.
<Page5>
Hisui and Kohaku-san finish cleaning up the dishes, and
immediately afterward...
<Page6>
"―――It seems that thorough re-education is
necessary."
She says firmly.
The devil's words, merciless in content and chilling in
tone, reverberate across the dining room.
<Page7>
"―――For whom, and what kind?"
"For you Nii-san, I want you to have an appropriate
attitude."
I knew it...
So that's what she was thinking while eating, with her
shapely eyebrows twitching...
<Page8>
"...What exactly do you mean by that?"
"The first thing to do is to improve your lifestyle.
Going out at night is naturally forbidden. The curfew
is set at eight o'clock.
Whenever you go out for any reason, you have to ask
permission from me, Kohaku, or Hisui."
<Page9>
"Wha...?"
Eight o'clock curfew? In this day and age? And even
worse, I need someone's permission just to go outside?
"Wait, wait, that's..."
<Page10>
"I will be setting up a study schedule for your days
off.
From what I have been told, your grades are completely
average, are they not?
...#My goodness. You are only good at cutting corners,
efficient as ever."
"No way. I'm doing my best."
<Page11>
"Be that as it may, while you live in this mansion, I
will have you take things seriously. Prepare for that.
I know you are a person who can do it if you put your
mind to it. Even taking your health into account, you
should be in the top three in your grade, no?"
<Page12>
My sister's overestimation stings.
And the thoroughness she used when researching my
grades is frightening.
<Page13>
"We will wait until you are a little more settled
before we do anything else.
So before that―――Nii-san, please take out that
thing."
"What?"
What  is she talking about?
<Page14>
"I am talking about that thing.
You have it, right? In your pants. That filthy thing is
the symbol of youth.
I am telling you to stop hiding it and take it out."
<Page15>
"No, I'm more confused than before!
Is this what they do in the upper class? What the hell
do you take normal folks for?!"
<Page16>
"Huh? I am telling you to take out your phone.
You do have a mobile phone, don't you?"
"――――――#I see."
<Page17>
I take out the phone I've been keeping in the back
pocket of my pants.
When I put it on the dining table, Hisui silently
collects it and hands it to Akiha.
<Page18>
"I am confiscating this. This type of electronic device
is prohibited in this house. They are unnecessary for
healthy students.
If you want to use a phone, use the one provided in the
lobby. If you want to do some research, please go to
the library."
<Page19>
Ending the conversation, Akiha walks out of the dining
room.
<Page20>
I'm standing here in shock for the umpteenth time
today, and this is the biggest one yet.
It's not like I'm a sore loser, but I'm not even the
type to be on his phone all the time.
I only use it to check my email or to read the news
while waiting. But I'm no different from other people
in that I consider my phone a basic necessity.
<Page21>
Once again, I shudder at the strictness of the Tohno
family. I can't believe that in the age of the
internet, a family that prohibits mobile phones still
exists!
