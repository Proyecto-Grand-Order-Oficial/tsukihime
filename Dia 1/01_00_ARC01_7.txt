<Page1>
In contrast to the pale tones of the living room, the
dominant theme of the office is red.
<Page2>
Luxurious curtains. A crimson carpet without a single
stain.
The air is heavy and dignified. You can't help but feel
the rich history of the room.
This is the office... of the head of the Tohno family.
Thus where Akiha sits before me was once Tohno
Makihisa's room.
<Page3>
"I have brought Shiki-sama with me."
"Thank you. You can go back to work, Kohaku."
"Yes. If you will excuse me."
<Page4>
Sounds like the maid's name is Kohaku.
She also gives me a small bow and leaves the room.
The only ones left are myself and―――two girls that I
don't recognize.
<Page5>

<Page6>
"It's been a while, Nii-san."
With a dignified look in her eyes, the girl with long
black hair says a word laden with meaning.
<Page7>
"――――――"
My mind is completely blank.
My thoughts have stopped entirely.
<Page8>
I can't even greet her properly, I'm only capable of
nodding at her words.
I'm a little disappointed in how pathetic I am, but
there's not much I can do about it.
The Akiha before me now looks very different from the
one I knew seven years ago.
<Page9>
"...Nii-san? Is there something wrong with this room?"
The black-haired girl narrows her eyes slightly, as if
carefully examining her suspicious visitor.
<Page10>
"Ah―――no."
My mind is still trying to catch up. I can only reply
with dumb words.
The cogs in my brain are turning at full speed,
struggling to process that the girl in front of me now
is Akiha. She, on the other hand, seems to have had no
trouble recognizing me as her brother.
<Page11>
"―――. I'd already been informed, but it would
appear your physical condition really is rather
unstable. While it is time poorly spent, would you
rather rest before we talk?"
...She addresses me.
Akiha's words seem to have a certain sting to them.
<Page12>
"A-Ah, no, my body's fine. I was just taken aback by
how much you've changed."
<Page13>
"...Things change after seven years. That's what it
means to grow up. Or did you think everything would
always stay the same, Nii-san?"
"No, that's not―――"
I'm so overwhelmed by the pressure she's exuding that I
trail off.
<Page14>
...Or rather, I start to reflect on everything.
I hadn't imagined what the current Akiha would be like.
I hadn't thought outside of the realm of childhood
memories convenient to me as her brother.
I wonder how the seven years have made Akiha develop.
Ah, but it's way too rude to think about this in front
of her.
<Page15>
"...I'm ashamed. To be honest, I didn't think it
through.
But then again, you've changed. You're remarkably more
beautiful than you used to be."
I give my honest opinion.
<Page16>
"Thank you.
Although you have not changed much since back then."
Akiha coldly makes an assertion with her eyes closed.
<Page17>
"........."
...Well, I was prepared for this, but...
It seems that Akiha doesn't think well of me after I
left the Tohno family.
<Page18>
"........."
"――――――"
<Page19>
The silence lasts a few seconds, as each of us tries to
get a read on the other.
I can't think of a casual greeting to say to my sister
with whom I'm reunited.
Akiha is observing me as if I were a
stranger―――which, I suppose, I am to her at this
point.
<Page20>
"...Well, that's fine then.
If you're feeling well, then let us finish our
conversation.
Have you been informed of the details regarding the
circumstances of your move?"
<Page21>
"No, I don't know the finer details. I was just told
that 'You are to come back to the mansion.' I knew our
old man had passed away though, I'd read about it in
the papers."
<Page22>
When the head of a business group passes away, it's
covered in the financial columns.
Even if he isn't informed by his relatives, a disowned
son can still learn of his parents' death from news
sites.
The news of Tohno Makihisa's death was delivered to the
Arima family after his funeral. It was as if it was
none of my business.
<Page23>
"...You have my apologies. It was my fault for not
informing you about Father."
<Page24>
Akiha quietly bows her head.
Her smooth black hair is beautiful... but now is not
the time to be admiring it. I shouldn't have said that
earlier.
<Page25>
"You don't have to worry about that.
It's not like the dead would have come back to life if
I was there. On the contrary, I'm glad I didn't have to
see any of my relatives."
Being disowned puts you in a complicated position in
many ways.
<Page26>
"...I see.
It makes me feel a little better to hear you say that."
<Page27>
The same goes for me, having a sister as frank as her.
Funerals are a ritual for those who cannot forget the
deceased to lay their feelings to rest.
We are father and son with ties long since severed.
I can't think of a single reason to say goodbye to
Tohno Makihisa. I have neither the right nor the duty
to see him off.
<Page28>
"But then, who called me back?
It's not like it was in his will, right?"
<Page29>
"It was my decision to call you back here, Nii-san.
It would be strange for the eldest son of the Tohno
family to be kept in the Arima house forever, would it
not? No matter what your defects are, you are still a
Tohno."
<Page30>
"........."
I've come to accept the word  as natural.
I heard it often from my father.
I don't feel any dissatisfaction or animosity toward
being told this now. Her assessment is absolutely
correct.
<Page31>
"Now that Father... that Tohno Makihisa has passed, the
only members of the Tohno bloodline left are you and
me, Nii-san.
That blood must be protected.
I do not know what Father had in mind when he entrusted
you to the Arima family, but he has passed away.
Without a definite reason to the contrary, as your
family, it's only natural to supervise you here."
<Page32>
Akiha's words are calm but compelling.
It is as if she is declaring in advance that she won't
listen to any of my complaints or protests.
<Page33>
"...Supervision, huh. So what would have happened if I
had refused to come back to the Tohno house?"
<Page34>
"The freedom to decide that is not yours. No one from
the Arima branch has the right to refuse a decision
from the head family.
You and I were both raised by the Tohno household. At
least until you reach adulthood and become an
independent member of society, it is your obligation to
serve the Tohno family."
<Page35>
"........."
That's what Makihisa said, too.
Parents have a responsibility to raise their children
and send them off as members of society.
<Page36>
A family is no more than the smallest <subdivision|c o m p a n y     > that
makes up a nation, and as a company, you mustn't ship
defective products.
To do so not only damages the name of the family, but
also lowers the quality of the whole country.
<Page37>
Those who cannot take on that responsibility are not
qualified to be parents, and children who cannot live
up to that responsibility have no reason to be part of
a family.
Tohno Makihisa told this to me and Akiha many times. It
was as if he was persuading himself, over and over
again.
<Page38>
"That was one of his favorite phrases, wasn't it?
So the reason you called me back is simply..."
It wasn't consideration for her brother, who was
disowned by their father.
<Page39>
"It's because regardless of how we got here, you are
the eldest son of the Tohno family.
Do you not think that is enough of a reason?"
As the head of the Tohno family, she is just cleaning
up a matter that had been left unattended.
<Page40>
"I am glad you understand.
Needless to say, you should take my words as those of
the head of the Tohno family. The family register may
list you as my older brother, but the hierarchy within
our family is something else entirely."
<Page41>
"Nii-san. I respect you as my brother, but at the same
time, as the one who is in charge of this house, I will
treat you as the property of the Tohno family.
Please forget about what happened seven years ago and
engrave into your mind that I am the head and you are
part of the family."
<Page42>
Akiha's voice is indifferent.
A prideful decision made from above. I truly felt that
it was cold-hearted.
But―――――
<Page43>
"Yeah, I understand when you put it like that.
I feel more at ease when I hear it from you straight."
This is a natural outcome.
It's nothing to be upset about.
<Page44>
"...You understand what I am saying?
It was my intention to use my position above you to
unilaterally force you to consent, but..."
<Page45>
"I know, and I'm not complaining. I mean, I'm going to
be treated this way no matter how I feel about it.
In fact, I'm grateful to you for treating me as your
brother, even after I lived a life of self-indulgence
for seven years."
"............"
<Page46>
"But regardless of what you think, didn't the relatives
object? Weren't they the ones who suggested that I stay
at the Arima house?"
<Page47>
"Yes, they did. However, I am the current head of the
family. I rejected all of their opinions.
I have made it clear that to interfere in this matter
is to go against me, and by extension, against the
Tohno family."
<Page48>
"――――――"
My eyes widen involuntarily.
Even Makihisa couldn't reject the branch families. But
for Akiha to persuade all of them... no, maybe she
argued them down.
...Well.
She has grown up well in appearance, but I wonder how
much she has grown up inside as well. The family
register says I'm her older brother, and I'm a little
scared of my sister's rapid development.
<Page49>
"...Nii-san?
You have a distant look on your face. What's wrong?"
<Page50>
"Oh, no, I'm impressed, or rather, moved... you've
really been recognized as the head of the family."
"Of course. Otherwise, I would not be able to call you
back, Nii-san."
<Page51>
"Back to the matter at hand.
From today on, you will be living in the mansion, but
there are rules and regulations here. You will refrain
from misbehaving like you did in the past, so please
keep that in mind."
<Page52>
"Huh? Haha, that's impossible, Akiha.
There's no way I can go back to being a well-behaved
person now, and I have no intention of trying to,
either."
<Page53>
"No, you will, no matter what.
You are not a child, so do not whine before trying.
Or are you implying that you are unable to do the
things that I can do?"
She shoots me a cold glance.
<Page54>
"――――――"
Or rather, her gaze is more like a piercing spear.
"Uh..."
There's no doubt about it. I'm now being mercilessly
bombarded with the animosity that has piled up during
these last seven years...
<Page55>
"...Okay. I'll try as hard as I can."
"You will try, will you? That is a convenient response.
Do you think that anyone who makes an effort will be
rewarded? The only thing I am looking for is results.
That is all."
<Page56>
"..."
I'm completely dumbfounded by her lack of even an ounce
of kindness.
<Page57>
"...Fine. You have been living a free and easy life
until now, so I do not expect you to change it
immediately.
I will give you a week at the very least and a month at
most, so try like your life depends on it."
<Page58>
I hold back the thought that this seems more like a
suspended sentence than being let off the hook.
Akiha is making a compromise in her own way, I'm sure.
<Page59>
"...You know what? It's not as difficult as it may
seem.
You and I are the only ones living in the mansion now.
It would have been hard for you to relax with all those
noisy relatives around, and they were quite a nuisance
for me as well, so I sent them away."
<Page60>
"―――"
Wait a minute... you don't mean...
"You got rid of all the relatives staying in the
mansion?"
#To think she was able to do that...!
<Page61>
"Yes, please do not worry about it.
They were simply leeches, lazily feeding off Father's
generosity even as they lost their own homes and
property. Sooner or later, we were going to ask them to
leave the mansion.
Oh, I have let most of the servants go, but I have left
one for each of us, so there is no problem."
<Page62>
"No, that's way too much! If you go around doing things
like that, you'll be brought up for questioning at the
next family reunion!"
<Page63>
"Please stop blathering on so much.
Surely you would agree that it is far better to have
the mansion to ourselves than for it to be teeming with
other people?"
<Page64>
....
Well, it really does make me feel better...
<Page65>
"...No, but, you know, is that really okay?
Even the old man didn't go against the opinions of our
relatives, so for you to force through something so
tyrannical and selfish..."
<Page66>
"That is right. That is why Father entrusted you to the
Arima family. But I have hated those people since I was
a child. From now on, I'm done. I'm fed up with
listening to their grumbling."
"'Fed up with'? Akiha―――"
<Page67>
"Oh, for heaven's sake, it's oh-so-wonderful that
you're so worried about the likes of me!
But you should be more worried about your own life from
now on. It's obvious that you are going to have a lot
of trouble going forwards."
<Page68>
Akiha said unpleasantly, forcing the discussion to a
close.
<Page69>
"I am sure you understand the situation, but it seems
that you still treat this as if you are living with the
Arima family.
...Well, not that it matters. I have a servant for that
purpose.
If you have any questions in the future, you can ask
her.
――――Hisui."
<Page70>
Without turning around, Akiha calls out to the girl who
has been waiting in the corner of the room.
<Page71>
The girl called Hisui steps forward and bows in my
direction.
It's an expressionless but polite bow, the embodiment
of sincerity.
<Page72>
"This girl is Hisui, a servant of our mansion.
She will be your maid from now on, is that alright?"
I see, so she's a servant here... wait, what?
<Page73>
"Wait, by maid, you mean..."
"A personal servant would be a better description."
<Page74>
...I can't believe it.
The girl in the maid's uniform looks to be the same age
as Akiha, and her face is devoid of expression in a
manner that seems almost natural for her.
<Page75>
"Wait a minute. Isn't a personal servant too much? I
can take care of myself..."
"Even when it comes to preparing meals and doing
laundry?"
Akiha mercilessly points out my shortcomings.
<Page76>
"In any case, now that you have returned to this
mansion, you will follow my instructions.
I do not know how you lived in the Arima house, but
from now on you are living here as the eldest son of
the Tohno family.
Please accept the appropriate treatment as your duty."
<Page77>
"..."
I cast a glance over the girl in the maid's uniform.
Hisui is still expressionless, just staring back at me
like a doll.
<Page78>
"Alright then, Hisui, please guide my brother to his
room.
It seems this man is no different from a cat who does
not know left from right. Do not let him get lost in
this big mansion."
"As you please, Akiha-sama."
<Page79>
After bowing to Akiha, Hisui quietly comes toward me.
She's staring straight at me, but I look all over the
place so that our eyes don't meet.
...Her pace is gentle but not slow, indicating that she
has been a servant for a long time.
<Page80>
"Oh, Nii-san. Even as the eldest son, there are certain
things that are forbidden in this mansion, like places
that you should not enter. Please do not violate these
rules.
I have also ordered Hisui to take care of you, so
please listen to her advice as much as possible."
<Page81>
"That seems more like being monitored than being taken
care of, don't you think?"
"If you live a proper life not breaking any rules,
Hisui will be relieved of that role.
With that, I will see you again at the dinner table."
<Page82>
It seems that Akiha has a packed schedule and doesn't
want to waste any more time.
<Page83>
"I will show you to your room, Shiki-sama."
Ignoring my confusion, Hisui heads for the door.
"...."
Sighing, I leave the office as well.
