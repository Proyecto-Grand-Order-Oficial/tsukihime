...I'll kill some more time.
There's no need to go rushing off.
It's not as if the situation is going to improve if I
spend all my time hurrying about.

I stroll aimlessly around the school.
There are almost no students in the building or on the
school grounds.
I'm glad that I haven't run into anyone I know, but
it's a bit eerie to see a place that's usually crowded
with people this quiet.

"Speaking of which..."
As I look around the empty school grounds, I remember
an incident from my middle school days.
On a snowy day in winter, I was walking home across an
empty schoolyard.
Hearing a noise from the supposedly empty storeroom, I
stopped by to see what was going on―――
<Page4>
"Hello. Are you a second-year?
I'm sorry, but can you please stay off the school
grounds after school?"
<Page5>
An upperclassman I don't know calls out to me.
I must have wandered onto the grounds without realizing
it.
<Page6>
"I'm sorry, I was just going for a walk. I'll be more
careful in the future."
I apologize for my carelessness and leave the grounds.
<Page7>
"Were you not going home?"
"...No, but I'm leaving now. Thank you for your
concern."
I thank the upperclassman and leave the school grounds.
<Page8>
It's a good excuse for me to make up my mind.
If I stay in school any longer, I will look suspicious.
I'll go back to the classroom, collect my bag, and
return to my 'real home' this time―――
