The main gate is firmly shut.
As a child, I knew that the Tohno mansion was 'pretty
big', but after living in the normal-sized Arima house,
it's finally sinking in just how huge this mansion
really is.
<Page2>
This entire hill overlooking the city is the property
of the Tohno family.
The plot with the mansion on it alone is larger than my
high school, and if you count the forest that spreads
out behind it, it's probably three times bigger.
<Page3>
The grounds are surrounded by a long wall and trees,
making it impossible to peek inside.
The main gate, which serves as the entrance to the
property, is closed and forbidding.
<Page4>
Next to the bigger gate for cars, there's a doorway for
people.
After a moment of hesitation, I press the button that
seems to be the doorbell.
<Page5>
Unlike a normal intercom, there is no ringing to be
heard by the person who pressed the button.
After a few seconds of waiting, the lock on the door
releases and the intercom buzzes, inviting me to enter.
<Page6>
"...The door is fully automatic now. There used to be a
guard..."
<Page7>
I open the heavy door and enter the premises, passing
through the stone gate.
The door locks tightly behind me with a satisfying
clunk.
<Page8>
After passing through the main gate, a gently sloping
path leads deeper and deeper into the forest.
Surrounded by tall trees, the path gives me the
impression of a tunnel.
It extends due east, then after about forty meters
makes a hard left turn to the north.
<Page9>
"――――――"
Memories come flooding back with each step; it's like
they're being colored in.
I know this path.
I ran along it countless times.
<Page10>
Almost there.
Arriving at the corner and with my feet facing
north―――on the left, there lies...
<Page11>
The Tohno mansion, towering high, like a great wall of
chalk.
I let out a sigh that could be of either admiration or
resignation.
<Page12>
It hasn't changed at all.
According to my father, the house was heavily renovated
after the war. The basic construction, however, was
inherited from my grandfather, who himself inherited it
from his own grandfather.
<Page13>
This is a castle for a powerful man. A man from a
family that has been in this land for hundreds of
years.
For Makihisa... no, for all members of the Tohno
family, this mansion is a sanctuary.
<Page14>
At the annual family reunions, there would always be a
handful of adults trying to curry favor with my father
so that he'd rent them a corner of the mansion.
<Page15>
They were all probably successful businessmen with
their own mansions. Yet, for some reason, they were
obsessed with living here.
They must have considered living here to be very
prestigious.
...Really, how ridiculous. I'm not familiar with the
values of the upper class, so for me, it's just a
'luxurious mansion'.
<Page16>
"......Alright."
There's no turning back now; not after I've come this
far.
Next to the double doors, there's an incongruous
doorbell.
<Page17>
I shake off my nervousness and push the doorbell.
There's no familiar  sound.
<Page18>
The heavy silence continues for several seconds.
I can hear the sounds of hurried footsteps coming from
the other side of the door.
<Page19>
"Welcome, we've been expecting you."
Despite its heavy appearance, the door opens lightly.
<Page20>
I squint at the light of the setting sun shining
through the window.
I had prepared for this situation, but I still gulp and
look around the vast lobby.
<Page21>
...Any visitor would be overwhelmed by the
architectural beauty.
I get the striking feeling that I've been transported
to a different country in a different time. The
interior of the mansion is so dated that even the
atmosphere is different.
<Page22>
Still, this is the Tohno residence lobby of my
memories.
<Page23>
I stand there motionless, across from the person who
came to greet me―――a girl in anachronistic clothes.
<Page24>
"Thank goodness. It was getting quite late, and so I
was starting to worry that you might have gotten lost.
If you had not made it here before sundown, I would
have come to get you."
The girl wearing a kimono and an apron laughs softly.
<Page25>
"Ah, no―――"
I'm so bewildered by this unexpected turn of events
that I can't speak coherently.
I'd assumed that the person waiting to welcome me would
have been the rugged-looking butler who had been
Makihisa's secretary.
<Page26>
"Hm?"
The girl tilts her head gently as if puzzled by my
confused attitude.
<Page27>
"You are Shiki-sama, right?"
"Y-Yes. Although, addressing me with a '-sama' is a bit
excessive."
<Page28>
"You are, right? Oh, please do not scare me like that.
I was afraid I made a mistake again."
<Page29>
The girl in the apron presses her forefinger to her
lips with a warning gesture, like a mother scolding her
child.
It would appear that she really did worry and is now
quite cross. Even so, the smile remains on her face,
and she still gives off a welcoming atmosphere.
<Page30>
...A kimono and an apron.
She's come to greet me and refers to me with a '-sama'.
So, this girl is――――
<Page31>
"Excuse me. Are you a maid here by any chance?"
"――――――"
She simply smiles in response to my question.
<Page32>
"You must be tired, right?
Please, come on in. Akiha-sama will be free to greet
you shortly, so please make yourself at home in the
living room until then."
<Page33>
The girl starts walking as if guiding me, her every
movement gentle and calm.
She heads toward the corridor on the east side of the
lobby, next to the grand staircase.
<Page34>
If I remember correctly, the door to the living room is
just inside that hallway.
I―――
C:> Decide to obediently follow her.
C:> Decide to stop the girl and ask for her name.
C:> ...Well, I think I'll explore the mansion a little.
