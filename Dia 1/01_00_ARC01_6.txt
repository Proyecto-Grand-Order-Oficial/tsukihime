The girl leads me to the living room.
The living room, which I haven't seen in seven years,
is so much more luxurious now that I feel as if I'm
seeing it for the first time.
<Page2>
I wonder if I've gotten too used to the Arima house, or
if the standards here have risen in these past seven
years.
Either way, I feel like this is a stranger's home, and
it makes me uncomfortable.
I start to look around the living room.

"... You sure seem unusually quiet all of a
sudden.
I understand how you feel, but please make yourself
comfortable. This is your home, after all, Shiki-sama."
"Y-Yeah, of course."
<Page4>
I hurriedly sit down on the sofa.
I just came back to my own house and I'm already
overwhelmed by everything, it's really pathetic.

The girl in the kimono moves the tea wagon located in
the corner of the living room closer, brews a cup of

"It's nothing special, but here you go."
"Ah, thank you."
<Page7>
I can't help but feel embarrassed as she serves me

"I must go and speak to Akiha-sama briefly, so please
sit tight for a moment.# It will probably take about ten
minutes, so you may want to look around the mansion
until then."
"Is it really fine for me to just wander around as I
please?"
<Page9>
"What are you talking about! This is your home now, how
could there be anything wrong with you walking around
it!
...#Ah, but you cannot go upstairs, Akiha-sama will be
there."
<Page10>
"Please feel free to look around as much as you'd like
so long as it is on the first floor.
It has been seven years since you have been to this
mansion. I'm sure you are feeling nostalgic and
excited."

She smiles mischievously.# 'If you may excuse me.'# The
girl, who I think is a maid, bows and leaves the room.

Kohaku-san bows and leaves the room.

"......I give up."
The lavishly-made living room made my muttering
reverberate even louder.
Should I stay here and pass the time being nervous,
or should I walk around the house?
I―――
C:> Will wait here quietly.
C:> Will go for a little walk.
