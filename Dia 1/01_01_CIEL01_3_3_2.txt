"What's the matter, Senpai? You don't look happy."
"Huh? Ah, well,# I was a little surprised that you
seemed to be more relaxed than I am."
<Page2>
"No, my family has always been strict, so I'm just used
to this kind of thing. More importantly, Senpai, what
did you want to talk to me about?"
<Page3>
"Oh, that's right.
To tell the truth, I'm dying to hear more about the
circumstances you mentioned at lunch."
"My circumstances... you mean about my family home?"
'Yes', nods Senpai.
<Page4>
"If you don't mind, that is.
It's just a little weird for someone to move at this
time of year, so I was wondering if you were in some
sort of trouble."
"I'll warn you now, it isn't all that interesting of a
story. You'd only be wasting your time."
<Page5>
"I don't mind if it's boring.
I just want to hear it."
"...Hmm. You're very curious, aren't you?"
'I guess so', she laughs.
<Page6>
"Then let's pick up where we left off.
You said you were returning to your old house, but does
that mean you've never been back to your family home?"
<Page7>
"Yes. For various reasons, I haven't been back there
for almost seven years. I've been taking a leave of
medical absence... or something like that. I got in an
accident when I was ten, and I've had chronic anemia
ever since.
The Tohno mansion was a little too hectic for me, so I
was entrusted to some relatives to recover in peace.
That's where I've lived until yesterday."
<Page8>
"Oh... that must have been hard.
Um, so how's your wound now?"
"It's healed perfectly. The only lingering after-effect
is anemia, but my father said that I had that before
the accident, so I'm not too concerned about it."
<Page9>
"I see... I'm sorry I made you dredge up something
painful.
Um, so does that mean that ever since you were ten,
you've been raised by these relatives in place of your
parents?"
<Page10>
"That's right. Their family name is Arima, and they
were very good people, too good for me."
My words are filled with gratitude for those people,
even if I do not consciously know it.
I think I was happy to have stayed in that house for
seven years.
<Page11>
"Were? You're speaking in the past tense. Are you
saying that the Arimas didn't treat you like family
because they knew that you would eventually return to
your original home?"
<Page12>
"Huh? No, that's not what I meant.
I didn't expect the Tohno family to call me back at
all. Keiko-san, the rest of the Arimas, and I all
thought we'd be living together forever."
"You didn't think they would call you back?
Even though you're the eldest son of the Tohno family?"
<Page13>
"Yes... to tell you the truth, my recovery was just a
front. My father and I never got along. It's more like
he threw me out of the house, using my injury as a
pretext to keep up appearances."
<Page14>
"...Are you sure you're not just misunderstanding
something?"
"Hmm, that's a good question.
If it is a misunderstanding, then all the better."
<Page15>
I respond to Senpai's words# as frankly as I can.
I'm sure I must be smiling.
It warms my heart to hear the concern in her voice as
she suggests that my father and I may have simply been
talking past each other.
<Page16>
"Sadly, there's no longer any way to know for sure.
The man in question passed away just the other day. His
death was so sudden that we didn't get a chance to
settle anything, so that seven-year-long
misunderstanding will forever go unresolved."
...That is.
If there ever truly  a misunderstanding.
<Page17>
"I see, so your father has passed away.
So that's why you're now able to return to your family
home?"
"Yes. The new head of the family demanded that I come
home as soon as possible. I'm a little worried about
what's in store, but I'll be living there again
starting today."
<Page18>
I finish the conversation.
Ciel-senpai takes a small breath, then stares back at
me as if she has something on her mind.
<Page19>
"Can I ask you something?"
Her voice has a serious edge to it, and I find myself
unconsciously straightening up.
"By all means. So long as it's something I can answer."
<Page20>
"I see. Then, I'll be straight with you.
Just now, you were talking about the Arima family in
the past tense. You're already thinking of them as
people you've cut yourself off from. Tohno-kun, did you
hate your foster family that much?"
<Page21>
Foster family―――does she mean the Arimas? I guess
they're the ones who looked after me for the last seven
years.
They may have been my mother and father, but they
weren't my real parents.
The house that served as my home was unfamiliar to me.
But none of that mattered at all―――
<Page22>
"No, I loved them. They openly embraced me despite the
fact I'm not even related to them by blood, and were so
warm and caring that I'd have been ashamed if I still
felt isolated or depressed.
I thought that I could get used to living like that,
believing in that unconditional love."
<Page23>
 ―――I knew that these people loved me.
     So, as soon as possible.
     I had to become a real part of their family―――
<Page24>
That's what I've been telling myself ever since I was a
child.
...For as long as I can remember, really.
I've been repeating that mantra over and over in my
mind for what feels like forever.
<Page25>
"―――But it didn't work out, did it?"
"Yeah. I guess you could say that I fall in and out of
love easily."
<Page26>
No matter how happy I was to be loved, the next day I
still felt like a stranger.
I just couldn't think of myself as one of them, and my
feelings would always peter out eventually.
<Page27>
That's why at the very least...
I try not to forget the fact that they cared for me.
<Page28>
"It's especially true when it comes to family. I
couldn't return the love my father and mother gave me.
I wonder why―――"
<Page29>
I couldn't get the thought out of my head that since I
couldn't do that, I wasn't really a part of their
family.
Maybe I suffered some sort of terrible trauma as a
child, and that's the reason that no matter where I go,
I always feel like a stranger to my own family.
<Page30>
Senpai remains silent.
She averts her gaze, her shoulders slumped
apologetically.
<Page31>
"See, I warned you it'd be a boring story.
I'm sorry for wasting your time, Senpai."
"No, not at all. I thought it was very worthwhile."
Trying to light up the mood, she forces a smile.
<Page32>
"But I have to say, I got more than I bargained for. I
thought you were a laid-back kinda guy."
<Page33>
"Yeah, I'm fundamentally a pretty relaxed person. I've
made it my motto to enjoy the present as much as
possible.
Isn't it better to look forward to what's ahead than
back on what's already over?"
Well, that's what Arihiko once told me.
<Page34>
"Looking forward to what's ahead, huh?
I like the way you think. I can't help but feel like
doing my best to cheer you on."
<Page35>
"Hmm, but if you're trying to enjoy life as much as
possible...
.... Well then, what do you say we start walking to
school together starting tomorrow?"
<Page36>
"Huh―――"
I'm a little shocked at the sudden invitation...
Actually, I'm more shocked that I've been talking about
myself this entire time. That's not like me at all.
<Page37>
"Ah, no, that's not what I meant! By enjoying myself I
just meant having a positive outlook, that's all! If I
was going to hit on you, I would have set the stage a
bit more beforehand, right?!"
"Yes, don't worry, I was just joking.
I know that you're a gentleman."
<Page38>
...I can't help but feel slightly disappointed, but at
least I didn't cause a misunderstanding.
I regain my composure and take a sip from my teacup.
The tea is stone cold after sitting out during our
lengthy conversation.
<Page39>
We end up talking for another hour.
It was enjoyable to have Senpai eagerly listening to
everything I had to say, but talking this much when I'm
not used to it is exhausting.
<Page40>
She particularly enjoyed my story about the school
trip, which apparently she couldn't take part in
because she'd come down with a cold the day before.
<Page41>
"That was the second year of junior high, so you must
have been fourteen at the time.
I would have liked to have seen you at that age."
Anyone would blush if she said that to them with that
smile on her face.
<Page42>
We could have talked on and on, but the sun would set
soon.
It's almost time to close down the tea ceremony room
for the day, so I take off ahead of Senpai and start
heading home.
