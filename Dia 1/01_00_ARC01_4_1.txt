I think back on the time I spent with my father, Tohno
Makihisa.
<Page2>
...Though, I don't actually remember doing anything
with him.
Makihisa was a strict father, a quiet man who didn't
let his emotions show.
<Page3>
'Do not go out, do not go into the city, people are
born with different statuses, protect our noble
bloodline, we must not be viewed as the same as the
others―――'
Those were Makihisa's rules, and by extension, the
rules of the Tohno family.
<Page4>
I rebelled against those rules.
I felt that my father's teachings were wrong.
Not because of a fault in his logic, he just never
managed to convince me.
...Maybe it was just me, but as a child, it felt like
his teachings didn't even belong in this .
<Page5>
Although I wasn't the only one who disagreed with
Makihisa's words, I was the only one who could defy him
face to face.
<Page6>
As a result, I began to ignore orders and would
frequently escape from the mansion. That's what led to
me being involved in the accident.
'The world outside the mansion is ugly. It is poison to
you.'
It's ironic.
The old man's favorite phrase ended up being true, even
if only for me.
<Page7>
After I woke up in the hospital, Makihisa didn't come
to visit me even once.
My final memory of him was him ordering me to 'go to
the Arima house' the day I returned to the mansion
after being discharged from the hospital.
<Page8>
That Makihisa isn't with us anymore either.
I think that the fact I'm not experiencing any strong
feelings about my father's death speaks volumes about
our relationship.
