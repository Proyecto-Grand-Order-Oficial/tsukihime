Suddenly, a question crosses my mind.
Why is she riding the train this early in the morning?
<Page2>
"But why?
Senpai, you're not a member of any clubs. Why are you
heading to school this early?"
<Page3>
"Well, to tell you the truth, I'm on my way back from
volunteering.
The student council asked for volunteers to pick up
trash in the park, remember?
That's what I was doing until just now."
<Page4>
As she says that, I let out an 'Ah' as everything
slides into place.
Senpai's the type that's always working hard for other
people's sake.
<Page5>
"It was just a thirty-minute early morning volunteer
activity.
Everyone else went back home for a while, but I thought
I'd just go straight to school because heading home
first would've been too much trouble."
Senpai's bag makes a clanking sound.
I thought it was something for her club activities, but
it seems to be cleaning equipment.
<Page6>
"Oh, do you want to see what's inside? You seem so
innocent on the outside, but you're really dying to
rummage through your Senpai's belongings... how bold!"
<Page7>
Senpai leans in close to look me in the eye.
Wait... Her face, her smell, and so many other things
are so close that I'm not even sure where to look.
<Page8>
"No, no, it's not that, I just thought that if you have
a foldable broom or a rake, that would be unusual..."
<Page9>
" , I see you also want to see my all-purpose
long-range pruning shears.
Very well. In that case, come by the tea ceremony club
after school. You're more than welcome."
<Page10>
I can't help but feel embarrassed, hearing her say that
with an infectious smile spread across her face.
Unable to come up with a witty reply, the best I can
muster is a weak 'yes'.
<Page11>
"It's a promise, then. Just between you and me, I've
purchased a surplus of snacks using the club funds.
They don't exactly have a great shelf life, so I need a
healthy boy to help me out."
"I-Is that so? Well, if my schedule permits, I'll
definitely come.
Although, getting lured in by food almost makes it seem
like I'm a cat."
<Page12>
Her smile is so friendly that I can't help but joke a
little.
<Page13>
The upperclassman with the green ribbon replies―――
"It's more like a puppy, I think.
I mean, felines are awful. Dutiful and intelligent
canines are the ones you can truly count on in the
end!"
She declares her oddly strong preferences with a
pleased look on her face.
<Page14>
Since we're headed the same way, our conversation
continues to roll on.
We talk about last week's midterm exams.
About the sports festival, which was reduced in scale
and only lasted a day.
About the cafeteria, where the menu has never changed.
About the controversy between the students and the
school over the use of mobile devices, which ends up
being a bit of a downer, so we change the topic and
laugh about our impressions of a movie we had recently
seen.
<Page15>
Fifteen minutes pass quickly.
This is the universally beloved Senpai that the rumors
describe―――she can really hold a conversation.
<Page16>
I don't want to think about the fact we'll soon arrive
at Souya Station, so I raise another topic.
―――But.
<Page17>
"Hey... you're making too much noise."
As she points out, we had forgotten about our
surroundings.
We both bow our heads to apologize.
"........."
<Page18>
"We got told off, huh..."
"Sorry...
I was laughing too loud, I guess."
<Page19>
After that, the conversation ends.
It's as though the friendly atmosphere we had
experienced up until now had been a lie.
Everyone is just a stranger, and a silence peculiar to
the city dominates the train.
<Page20>
The train arrives at Souya Station.
It's just before seven o'clock.
It's a little early for school, and the city is still
asleep.
The station is quiet now, but in an hour, it will be
full of people and cars.
<Page21>
"There's not much traffic this morning either. It seems
like the city is waking up late these days. I wonder if
everyone is staying up late."
Senpai says something strange while carrying her heavy
luggage.
<Page22>
"Um... would you like me to take your luggage to
school?"
"Huh? Ah, no, no, don't worry about it. I have a stop
to make, so I'll leave you here."
<Page23>
And so, waving her hand with a smile, Senpai runs off.
It's such a light and fast run that an onomatopoeic
 would be appropriate.
I almost want to break into a run as well, so as not to
be outdone, but I have no particular reason to hurry.
Besides, I have my body to worry about. I'll just head
to school at my usual pace.
<Page24>
And then...
The girl from earlier comes out of the ticket gate.
<Page25>
She walks past me at a fast pace―――
"You're as thoughtless as you look. Disgusting."
―――and leaves behind some scathing criticism.
<Page26>
"――――――"
I'm stunned by her sudden rebuke.
Apparently, I really offended her.
<Page27>
From now on, I'll be more careful when talking on the
train.
I may have unintentionally said something that made
people uncomfortable.
<Page28>
Well, even if you take that into account,
"Man... middle school students these days sure are
intimidating."
To give so harsh a critique while simply passing by,
she's like a samurai casually executing a peasant.
