―――Suddenly, I wake up.
<Page2>
Without anyone waking me up,
without hearing anything,
seemingly without any reason,
I wonder when it last was that I woke up in the middle
of the night.
<Page3>
I feel like I've forgotten something, so I sit up
restlessly.
<Page4>
There's an uneasy feeling in my chest, so I leave the
room to see if anything's going on.
<Page5>
I'm thirsty, so I go down the hallway in search of
water.
<Page6>
A long, moonlit corridor.
The sounds of the night after the residents have all
fallen asleep.
...How nostalgic.
I'm sure I've walked down a path like this before.
Wandering in a daze and paying no heed to my
surroundings, I begin to climb the stairs.
<Page7>
It's a blind spot in the mansion.
The staircase not only connects the first floor to the
second, but on the other side, there's a secret passage
that leads to the attic.
<Page8>
It has long since been forgotten, even by the
residents.
The mansion's attic, once used as a storehouse, hasn't
been accessed by anyone for several years.
<Page9>
Despite only being October, tonight is as cold as the
middle of winter.
I search through the luggage for a blanket.
An old cabinet catches my attention, so I open a
worn-out drawer to look inside.
<Page10>
"――――――"
There's nothing but small, insignificant things inside.
The contents of the open drawer rattle about.
<Page11>
I feel disappointed, as if I had opened a treasure
chest only to find a few pebbles scattered inside.
There are badges, accessories, binoculars, and other
miscellaneous items collected by children lying around.
Among them lies one item that clearly stands apart from
the others.
<Page12>
It's a dirty bandage stored in a transparent plastic
case.
It's neatly rolled up, but too old to be of any use.
There's nothing here.
Closing the drawer, I decide to go back to my room.
<Page13>
On my way out.
For no apparent reason, I notice that my cheeks are
wet.
Maybe.
Maybe there was a time when I used this place as a kid.
