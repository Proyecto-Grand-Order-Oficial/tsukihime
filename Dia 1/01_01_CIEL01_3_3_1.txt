"What's the matter, Senpai? You don't look happy."
"Huh? Ah, well,# I was a little surprised that you
seemed to be more relaxed than I am."
<Page2>
"No, my family has always been strict, so I'm just used
to this kind of thing.
...More importantly, Senpai, what did you want to talk
to me about?"
<Page3>
"Yes. I hadn't thanked you yet for this morning. I
caused you a bit of bother on the train, right? I
wanted to service you like this by way of an apology."
With a soft smile on her face, Senpai says something
outrageous.
<Page4>
"U-Um, you're using Japanese wrong, Senpai."
"Oh, really? Well, isn't being polite and hospitable
called servicing...?"
<Page5>
"It's not. I don't think it's wrong, but it's not quite
right either."
<Page6>
"...I-Is that so? I'm sorry, I unknowingly said
something strange. I guess one shouldn't speak in a
manner that doesn't match their heart after all."
<Page7>
Senpai slumps her shoulders.
...Seeing her so remorseful makes me feel a little
guilty as well.
<Page8>
"...Well. Your heart was in the right place. If I'm
being honest, it made me happy to hear it.
They say etiquette comes first from the heart, and if
one's feelings are genuine, minor mistakes can be
laughed off."
I end up giving her some words of encouragement.
<Page9>
Senpai is staring at me intently.
...Her eyes are so serious that I feel as if I'm a rare
animal in a zoo.
<Page10>
"............"
"...Senpai?"
Being stared at like this is pretty embarrassing, and
not just because I'm unused to it.
<Page11>
"―――Tohno-kun, it suits you a little too well.
You're younger than me, and yet you're so composed and
cheeky."
<Page12>
Senpai glares at me disapprovingly.
This is the second time that I can't understand her
thought process at all.
<Page13>
"I'm sorry. That was kind of an arrogant thing to say,
wasn't it?"
"Yes. It was so cheeky that I actually found myself a
little moved. It's kind of embarrassing to have a
younger boy do that to you."
<Page14>
Despite her words, Senpai has an embarrassed, but happy
grin on her face.
I'm...  sure she's not actually angry.
<Page15>
"I've taken somewhat of a sudden interest in you,
Tohno-kun.
I'd love for you to tell me more about yourself,
doesn't matter what exactly."
"...I mean, if you insist.
I don't think I make for very interesting subject
matter though, Senpai."
<Page16>
'No problem', Senpai replies with a smile.
...I guess there's nothing for it. I'm not sure if I
can live up to her expectations, but I'll just talk
about what happened at school―――
<Page17>
...We end up talking for about an hour.
It was enjoyable to have Senpai eagerly listening to
everything I had to say, but talking this much when I'm
not used to it is exhausting.
<Page18>
She particularly enjoyed my story about the school
trip, which apparently she couldn't take part in
because she'd come down with a cold the day before.
<Page19>
"That was the second year of junior high, so you must
have been fourteen at the time.
I would have liked to have seen you at that age."
Anyone would blush if she said that to them with that
smile on her face.
<Page20>
We could have talked on and on, but the sun would set
soon.
I excuse myself to Senpai and reluctantly leave the tea
ceremony room.
