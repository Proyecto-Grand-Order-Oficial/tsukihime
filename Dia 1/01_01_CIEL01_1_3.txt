<Page1>
Still... I'm curious.
More than the bag on her shoulder, I find my eyes drawn
to the pair of legs that have slipped into view.
<Page2>
"――――――"
The splendid sweep of her legs is the manifestation, or
perhaps even the embodiment, of living energy.
Though still, they manifest the lively motion of
smoothly flowing water.
This is what I would call beauty in form. I can't look
away. In fact, forget looking away―――I'm actively
being drawn in.
<Page3>
"Um... Tohno-kun?"
<Page4>
Then, I realize that beauty and strength go hand in
hand.
Her legs are quite plump, but the truth is, these are
the legs of a sprinter.
I heard through the grapevine that at the physical
fitness test the other day, she beat out the track team
to set a new record for our school. These are legs that
can run 100 meters in 13 seconds... I'm struck by the
sense that I'm gazing at a living gem.
<Page5>
"Ummm, you know, your face is very close to my... and
the movement of your hands..."
"I'm sorry. I'm in the middle of a serious
conversation."
"I-I see. A 'serious conversation', is it?"
<Page6>
Alas, the sad truth of the matter is I'm neither her
trainer nor a rival athlete.
Even if I were to somehow obtain the secret of speed
itself, there's no way I could suddenly master the art
of running.
<Page7>
"Ah, no, but you see, I have absolutely no idea what
you're so serious about!"
"Well of course. I don't understand either."
<Page8>
How can I put into words the psychology of being
attracted to something beautiful?
However, isn't there something wrong if we can't
adequately describe beauty? If we can't honestly admit
that something is beautiful?
When will human beings be able to transcend all
prejudices and discrimination, and talk about the
essence of things?
<Page9>
"!?"
"T-Tohno-kun, are you alright?!
Something just hit you on the head?!"
"Yeah... I'll survive, just about."
<Page10>
With the side of my head still smarting from the
impact, I pick up the object that had fallen onto the
seat.
It's a palm-sized lump of metal that sparkles
lustrously.
Pretty clearly just a smartphone.
<Page11>
"Excuse me. Did something fly over here?"
"I guess you mean this... It came in at a pretty
incredible angle. Do you have an app that lets you fly
it around like that?"
<Page12>
"Are you an idiot? Thank you very much."
The girl takes the phone as if nothing had happened,
and walks over to a door one row of seats away.
<Page13>
"........."
"........."
We stare at each other, reeling from what just
happened.
<Page14>
Anyway, I come back to my senses.
I clear my throat to break the tension.
<Page15>
"I'm sorry, I got a little distracted.
More importantly, is something the matter? Senpai,
you're not a member of any clubs. Why are you heading
to school this early?"
<Page16>
"Well, to tell you the truth, I'm on my way back from
volunteering.
You see, the student council asked for volunteers to
pick up trash in the park, right? That's what I was
doing until just now."
<Page17>
As she says that, I let out an 'Ah' as everything
slides into place.
Our attractively bespectacled Senpai is always working
hard for the sake of others.
<Page18>
"It was just a thirty-minute early morning volunteer
activity.
Everyone else went back home for a while, but I thought
I'd just go straight to school because heading home
first would've been too much trouble."
<Page19>
The bag on Senpai's shoulder makes a clanking sound.
I thought it was something for her club activities, but
it seems to be cleaning equipment.
<Page20>
"Oh, do you want to see what's inside? You seem so
innocent on the outside, but you're really dying to
rummage through your Senpai's belongings... how bold!"
<Page21>
Senpai leans in close to look me in the eye.
Wait... her face, her body, and so many other things
are so close that I'm not even sure where to look.
<Page22>
"No, no, it's not that, I just thought that if you have
a foldable broom or a rake, that would be unusual..."
<Page23>
" , I see you also want to see my all-purpose
long-range pruning shears. Very well. In that case,
come by the tea ceremony club after school. You're more
than welcome."
<Page24>
I can't help but feel embarrassed, hearing her say that
with an infectious smile spread across her face.
Unable to come up with a witty reply, the best I can
muster is a weak 'yes'.
I don't know where the tea ceremony club room is, but I
can find that out later.
<Page25>
"It's a promise, then. Just between you and me, I've
purchased a surplus of snacks using the club funds.
They don't exactly have a great shelf life, so I need a
healthy boy to help me out."
<Page26>
"I-Is that so? Well, if my schedule permits, I'll
definitely come.
Although, getting lured in by food almost makes it seem
like I'm a cat."
<Page27>
Her smile is so friendly that I can't help but joke a
little.
The upperclassman with the green ribbon replies―――
<Page28>
"It's more like a puppy, I think.
I mean, felines are awful. Dutiful and intelligent
canines are the ones you can truly count on in the
end!"
She declares her oddly strong preferences with a
pleased look on her face.
<Page29>
Since we're headed the same way, our conversation
continues to roll on.
We talk about last week's midterm exams.
About the sports festival, which was reduced in scale
and only lasted a day.
About the cafeteria, where the menu has never changed.
About the controversy between the students and the
school over the use of mobile devices, which makes us
both sigh, so we change the topic and laugh about our
impressions of a movie we had recently seen.
<Page30>
Fifteen minutes pass quickly.
This is the universally beloved Senpai that the rumors
describe―――she can really hold a conversation.
I don't want to think about the fact we'll soon arrive
at Souya Station, so I raise another topic.
―――But.
<Page31>
"Hey... you're making too much noise."
As she points out, we had forgotten about our
surroundings.
<Page32>
We both bow our heads to apologize.
"........."
<Page33>
"We got told off, huh..."
"Sorry...
I was laughing too loud, I guess."
<Page34>
After that, the conversation ends.
It's as though the friendly atmosphere we had
experienced up until now had been a lie.
Everyone is just a stranger, and a silence peculiar to
the city dominates the train.
<Page35>
The train arrives at Souya Station.
It's just before seven o'clock.
It's a little early for school, and the city is still
asleep.
The station is quiet now, but in an hour, it will be
full of people and cars.
<Page36>
"There's not much traffic this morning either. It seems
like the city is waking up late these days. I wonder if
everyone is staying up late."
Senpai says something strange while carrying her heavy
luggage.
<Page37>
"Um... would you like me to take your luggage to
school?"
"Huh? Ah, no, no, don't worry about it. I have a stop
to make, so I'll leave you here."
<Page38>
And so, waving her hand with a smile, Senpai runs off.
It's such a light and fast run that an onomatopoeic
 would be appropriate.
<Page39>
I feel like running along with her, but I have no
particular reason to hurry.
Besides, I have my body to worry about. I'll just head
to school at my usual pace.
<Page40>
And then...
The girl from earlier comes out of the ticket gate.
She walks past me at a fast pace―――
<Page41>
"You're like an animal.
Don't you feel embarrassed to be acting like that in
public?"
―――and leaves behind some scathing criticism.
