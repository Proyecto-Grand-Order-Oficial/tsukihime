Before that, I want to explore the mansion a little
more.
Even though it's my home, seeing this mansion again has
stirred up my feelings.
<Page2>
"Excuse me. Before we go to the living room, do you
mind if I take a look around the other rooms? It's kind
of nostalgic."
There used to be a playroom on the second floor of the
west wing...
<Page3>
"Oh. So you remember it."
<Page4>
"But, my apologies.
The large rooms such as the playroom, the library, and
the parlor have been locked since Akiha-sama became the
head of the family.
Even if you are the eldest son, you are not allowed to
use these rooms without her permission."
<Page5>
"Ah... I see. That's too bad."
She refuses me flatly. Having lost some face, I turn my
gaze away.
<Page6>
"I can't use the house quite so freely after all, can
I?"
"No, I am sure she will allow you to as soon as you
greet her.
Ah, but―――"
<Page7>
"It would be appreciated if you would ask permission
first before entering a locked room.
The Tohno residence has strict security not only on the
outside but also on the inside. If you were to enter
any such rooms without approval, I wouldn't be able to
guarantee your safety."
<Page8>
"My safety? You're exaggerating, right? Are there going
to be darts flying at me?"
<Page9>
"No.
Something more terrifying than any darts―――the
thunder of our strict master."
The servant smiles jokingly and once more goes to usher
me down the corridor.
I guess she wants me to go to the living room to rest
first.
<Page10>
"Welcome home, Shiki-sama.
I look forward to working for you."
<Page11>
Unable to come up with an appropriate reply to her
polite greeting, I timidly follow her.
