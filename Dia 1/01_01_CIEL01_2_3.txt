<Page1>
It's lunch break, and the corridor is filled with a
jumble of students headed this way and that.
Most of them are on their way to the cafeteria, but
some are going to visit their friends' classes with
lunchboxes in hand, or making their way to the
courtyard or the gym.
<Page2>
Losing myself in the crowd, I wonder if I should have a
proper lunch in the cafeteria or buy a loaf of bread at
the store.
<Page3>
At the end of the corridor, I see the familiar figure
of Senpai.
<Page4>
"...?"
Is it my imagination?
Or is she coming straight toward me...?
<Page5>
"Oh good, I've been looking for you, Tohno-kun.
You saved me the trouble of having to visit your
classroom."
<Page6>
"W-Well, that's great. Good to see you, Ciel-senpai."
For some reason, I feel embarrassed and reply with a
lackluster greeting.
<Page7>
"Yes, good to see you too.
Although, we've already met today, so 'good to see you'
isn't the right phrase."
"Oh... yeah. I guess you're right."
<Page8>
I look away, feeling more and more embarrassed.
Why is that I wonder...?
I should be used to talking to Senpai, but today I'm
unusually conscious of her. I wonder if it's because
she saw me absorbed in my thoughts this morning.
<Page9>
"Tohno-kun...? You seem somewhat restless, are you in a
hurry or something?"
<Page10>
"No, I'm not in a hurry. Not at all."
I can't just admit to her that I'm fascinated by every
little move she makes.
"Anyway, Senpai, you were looking for me. Is there
something I can help you with?"
<Page11>
"Yes. I'm sure I caused you some trouble this morning,
didn't I?
I wanted to apologize for that, so I've been looking
for you."
<Page12>
"Trouble this morning... Ah, you mean on the train?
But that was more of a blessing than a nuisance."
It was fun talking with Ciel-senpai.
I felt like the trip to the station just flew by as a
result.
<Page13>
"Well, but we got yelled at by that girl for being
noisy.
That's what I'm apologizing for. If you don't mind me
asking, were you on your way to get lunch?"
"Yes. I was trying to decide if I should go to the
cafeteria or just buy something."
<Page14>
"Great, then let me join you. Let's go to the
cafeteria. I'll treat you to make up for what happened
this morning."
"Huh?"
With a smile on her face, Senpai grabs my arm and
starts walking.
<Page15>
A third-year student standing in the second-years'
hallway is already enough to stand out, but this is
really going to turn some heads.
All of the students in the hallway are looking our way
and busily whispering amongst themselves.
<Page16>
"W-Wait a minute...!
What happened this morning was my fault, so there is no
need for you to apologize...! In fact, it's the other
way around. I should be the one apologizing!"
Realizing that I'm blushing, I extricate myself from
Senpai's arm.
<Page17>
". I can't ignore that. You're the one who should be
apologizing? What I'm hearing is that you'll do me a
favor as punishment, right?"
<Page18>
"――――――"
Her teasing glances make my already red cheeks even
redder.
<Page19>
"No, that was just a figure of speech."
"Then give it up and let me take you to the cafeteria.
I'm in the mood to have lunch with someone. Consider it
bad luck and let me treat you."
<Page20>
That's just unfair...
If someone smiles at me like that, I can't possibly say
no.
<Page21>
"... You say you're treating me, but this is quite
the opposite, Senpai."
<Page22>
"I mean it, I really enjoyed talking to you on the
train.
So let's hurry to the cafeteria!
If we don't, there won't be any free seats left!"
<Page23>
Ciel-senpai takes my hand again and walks briskly down
the corridor.
<Page24>
We must have beaten the crowds, as there are plenty of
open tables in the cafeteria.
Though there is a sizable queue at the counter already,
it shouldn't take more than about... five minutes or so
to order.
<Page25>
"I'll go get in line. Tohno-kun, please save a seat for
me. Is there any food you don't like? If so, you should
tell me now."
<Page26>
"Nope, none. I don't have any likes or dislikes in
particular."
"That's a very good answer.
Then, I'll be back in a flash."
<Page27>
Without waiting for my reply, Ciel-senpai gets in line
to order.
"........."
I guess I'll have to accept that I'm being treated to
lunch today.
<Page28>
"Vacant seats for two... if possible, seats in a corner
would be nice..."
I'm not sure if my mind can handle this whole situation
of having lunch with Ciel-senpai.
<Page29>
So I'd prefer to sit in a place where we can't be seen
by many people.
Looking around the cafeteria, I see that there are some
empty seats in the middle, but the corner seats are
already occupied by other students' belongings.
At this hour, there are no corner seats for two
people―――
"Oh――― There's one."
<Page30>
".........."
However, the table is about to be occupied by a
familiar face.
<Page31>
"Yo, Tohno, c'mere c'mere."
<Page32>
An orange-haired delinquent is waving his hand in the
air, with no regard at all for the stares of the people
around him. What a headache.
<Page33>
That said, ignoring him would be rude and there are no
other empty corner seats available.
In a way, he is a man who can keep people away. I
suppose it's my duty as his friend to take advantage of
his useful qualities.
<Page34>
"You're late. Didn't I tell you there'd be a special
guest today? Quit acting like the world revolves around
your schedule."
<Page35>
"Ah, I remember you saying something like that.
So, where is this special guest?"
<Page36>
"Mmm, that's the thing. It's been on the schedule since
yesterday, but she canceled on me this morning.
Something about how 'I'm busy at lunch today because
there's someone I want to apologize to'."
His shoulders slump in disappointment as he eats his
chikara udon.
<Page37>
"Someone she wants to apologize to?"
That sounds all too familiar.
"This special guest, is she a third-year by any
chance?"
"!"
<Page38>
"A short-haired girl who looks good in glasses and is
both restless and cheerful, but still comes off as
dependable?"
"What the hell, since when can you read my thoughts?!"
"No... that's not it, it's just..."
<Page39>
"Sorry for the wait.
Are you sure you want to sit here, Tohno-kun?"
<Page40>
Senpai comes over with a radiant smile.
In her hands, she carries a tray with food for two
people.
<Page41>
"What the hell?!"
"Hmm? Inui-kun,# what a coincidence."
Senpai nonchalantly takes a seat at the table.
She chooses the seat opposite me―――putting her next
to Arihiko.
<Page42>
"――― !?"
Arihiko makes an unfamiliar sound. Perhaps he can't
cope with his sudden good fortune. I know what he's
going through―――I felt the same way not too long
ago.
<Page43>
"Please help yourself, Tohno-kun.
Don't hesitate to fill up on food today."
<Page44>
There's no way I can say no to a smile like that.
I give up and sit down in the seat facing Ciel-senpai.
<Page45>
"Alright then, thank you very much."
I clasp my hands together and look down at the tray
that Senpai has brought.
<Page46>
"...?"
On the tray, there was# curry rice,# curry rice,# and
curry udon.
"............"
Wait, what??
<Page47>
"Um, Senpai...?"
"Yes? What is it, Tohno-kun?"
"No, this―――what is the meaning of this?"
<Page48>
"What do you mean, it's lunch for you and me. What else
could it be?"
"Yes, but I can only see curry..."
<Page49>
"Of course, it's everyone's favorite, classic curry."
You don't have to tell me that. The problem is that
there is  curry.
<Page50>
"You bought three dishes..."
"Of course. You're a growing boy, so you need to eat
up. I'm fine with just one dish, so please choose
whatever you like."
<Page51>
"Then, I'll have curry rice and curry udon."
Any other combination will just be having the same dish
twice.
<Page52>
"Please don't leave any food behind.
You're not a picky eater, right, Tohno-kun?"
"――――――――"
There isn't a trace of malice in her smile.
She isn't joking around or pulling a prank on me here,
she really does have only the best of intentions.
<Page53>
"Thanks for the meal."
I resign myself to my fate and dip my spoon into the
curry rice.
And then.
"Damn you, Tohno-kun!"
The man whose brain malfunctioned a minute ago has
finally rebooted.
<Page54>
"How long are you gonna keep giving your dear best
friend the cold shoulder?! You should be like 'Hey!
Thanks for always being alive, Inui-kun! Oh! By the
way, I should totally introduce you to my beautiful
senpai today! Oh no! Something came up! Time to go to
the back of the school, why don't the two of you have a
pleasant chat!' Also, if you have any leftover curry
udon, you can give it to me!"
"You're not getting anything. But thank you for always
being alive, Inui-kun."
<Page55>
Arihiko's arm darts in my direction.
I skillfully guard the curry udon against those evil
hands.
<Page56>
"Huh? Inui-kun, you know Tohno-kun?"
"What are you talkin' about? I don't just  him,
we've been best buds since middle school!"
My so-called 'best bud' reiterates strongly.
<Page57>
"I see. I'm sorry I broke my promise. You see, the
person I caused trouble for this morning was
Tohno-kun."
<Page58>
"It's okay! It's for a good reason. I would've brought
him here myself if you'd told me his name.
So, what bad things did this guy do to you anyway?"
<Page59>
"We bumped into each other on the train early in the
morning, and while we were chatting, another passenger
got angry.
It's all my fault, I should have been more mindful of
the people around us. Tohno-kun didn't do anything
wrong, but he got yelled at because of me."
<Page60>
"Ah, an early morning train? I feel like people have
every right to talk if they want to.# Wait. Early
morning? I know Tohno does, but do you come to school
by train as well?"
<Page61>
"I was on my way back from volunteering this morning.
Picking up trash in the park.
Didn't you see the bulletin board at school? Students
were asked to volunteer."
<Page62>
"Ah, that thing at the seaside park... as expected of
Senpai, thanks for your hard work.
The teachers rely on you because you do stuff like that
though. They'll slack off any chance they get, so I
kinda wish you wouldn't let them get away with it."
<Page63>
"It's okay, I do it because I like it.# Besides, the
teachers are thinking about the school. I don't like
the way you're talking about them, Inui-kun."
<Page64>
Ciel-senpai ruthlessly rebukes Arihiko's lazy opinions.
From the looks of it, he seems to be close to her in
his own way.
<Page65>
"Senpai, do you do volunteer work every day by any
chance?"
"What, you didn't know? Ciel-senpai here is such a
handy person that she's called the true student council
president."
<Page66>
"I know. She's the perfect third-year who can solve
anything, unlike the so-called student council."
<Page67>
"Yeah. There's a fan club made among the first-years,
and whenever something troublesome happens, even asking
the teachers would get you nothing more than a 'just
talk to Ciel and you'll be fine'. Nowadays, Senpai
could do just about anything and the teachers wouldn't
complain."
Arihiko sounds so proud you'd think he was talking
about himself.
<Page68>
"I didn't know there was even a fan club... You're
amazing, Ciel-senpai. It's a big deal to be counted on
by our teachers, that's for sure."
I look at Senpai with admiration.
<Page69>
"Ah, yeah. Well, thank you very much."
<Page70>
Senpai stirs her curry rice with a spoon.
I suppose it is to hide her embarrassment, but it also
reminds me of my immediate enemy.
Curry rice isn't the only thing on my plate, I also
have to contend with the curry udon.
<Page71>
Although the doctor has warned me not to eat too much,
I would feel sorry for Senpai if I didn't finish eating
both.
I guess I'll start with the curry rice, and try to
enjoy it before I start to get too full.
<Page72>
As I eat, Senpai and Arihiko talk about each other's
current residences.
I knew that Arihiko's parents had passed away, but it
seems that Ciel-senpai is living alone as well.
<Page73>
Apparently her apartment is pretty close to Souya
Station.
It seems that she's renting an apartment in the
residential area to the east of the south gate where
the business district is, instead of the north gate
where the downtown area is.
<Page74>
"Oh, yeah.
By the way, where do you live, Tohno-kun?"
"Yes?"
As I'm eating curry rice in peace, Senpai suddenly asks
me a question.
<Page75>
"Where do I live? That's a bit of a difficult question
to answer..."
After all, I'll be living somewhere else starting
today.
I don't feel comfortable explaining the situation. If
possible, I'd like to keep it vague so I don't have to
answer the question.
<Page76>
But I find it hard to squeeze out even a half-hearted
lie when someone is staring straight at me like this.
<Page77>
"I'll answer that with a question...
Why do you want to know where I live?"
<Page78>
"Huh? But you asked me where my apartment was, didn't
you? I think it's unfair that I'm the only one who
doesn't know where you live.# Um... is that weird?"
<Page79>
"Well, it's a little weird.
To say it's unfair, that's a strange thing to worry
about, isn't it, Senpai?"
<Page80>
"Mm. It's not strange.
If I don't know where you live, I won't be able to
visit if something happens to you."
<Page81>
I stop chewing on my curry rice.
I feel like I just heard her say something that would
make any man happy.
<Page82>
"Visit me...? As in, if I catch a cold, will you come
to visit me?"
"No, I won't.
At the moment, I have no intention of doing so."
<Page83>
"........."
I guess I was celebrating too early.
Senpai has no such intentions.
I see. In other words, she's just an airhead, isn't
she?
<Page84>
"My house is in the city too. It's about a
thirty-minute walk from here.
If you head up into the suburbs from the north gate,
you know that residential area on top of the hill? It's
at the end of that."
<Page85>
"Oh, that's right. You're moving in today, right?"
Arihiko deliberately interjects.
Senpai tilts her head slightly.
<Page86>
"Moving in? Are you a transfer student?"
"Huh?"
Senpai says something strange.
Arihiko and I just silently make eye contact with each
other.
<Page87>
"Look here, I've been in this school since the first
year, and I've known you since then.
What made you suddenly think that I'm a transfer
student?"
"Well, because you're moving―――"
<Page88>
"Moving doesn't necessarily mean I'm going to transfer.
I'm just changing addresses, not schools.
I've been living with my relatives up til now, but from
today on I'll be back at my old house."
<Page89>
After a look of surprised incomprehension from Senpai,
she seems to grasp the situation.
<Page90>
"So you just changed your address.
And now you've moved to a residential area in the
suburbs."
"That's right. To the ostentatious place at the top of
the hill."
<Page91>
"I see, that makes sense. Are you talking about the
Tohno mansion?"
<Page92>
Senpai asks hesitantly.
To the people from the city, the Western-style building
on the hill must be something special.
I haven't been back for seven years, but the Tohno
mansion in my memory is as big as a castle to me.
<Page93>
"Exactly. I know it doesn't really suit me, but now
that I've moved, it is what it is."
<Page94>
"Mmm, I guess you aren't too enthusiastic about it
after all.
Guess you can't help it if you haven't been in your old
home for seven years. It'll feel like someone else's
for a while, right?"
"I wonder. I haven't dropped by yet, so I don't really
know how it feels.
Well, if push comes to shove, I can always take shelter
at your house."
<Page95>
"Whaaaaat the hell? Screw you, my house isn't your
bivouac spot. During days off, you'd come over to stay
overnight. Thanks to that, my sister has become more
partial to you, my friend Tohno-kun, than me. Now my
allowance is decreasing every year!"
<Page96>
I think it's due to his bad behavior, but I decide not
to mention it because it would complicate things.
To be honest, I don't feel comfortable talking about
the Tohno family.
<Page97>
". You two are really close, aren't you?"
"We're not. He and I do compete with one another, but
we never join forces. Basically, we're enemies,
mademoiselle."
<Page98>
"But he even stays at your house, doesn't he? That's
really close."
<Page99>
"That's not it, Senpai. He ran away just because he
didn't wanna stay home during summer break. This
bastard feels a bit guilty about being dropped on the
Arimas."
<Page100>
"So, he comes to me when I have a room available. My
sister likes him because he's good-looking, and so he's
bold enough to stay with us without even bringing
anything!"
<Page101>
Arihiko shakes his fist as if saying that he won't
forgive me.
I see... so that is the reason why... I'll bring a
souvenir or two next time.
<Page102>
"As in... Tohno-kun was entrusted to the Arima family?"
Arihiko clams up, realizing he's said too much.
He puts on an uncharacteristically sheepish grin.
<Page103>
"Don't worry about it. It's not like it's anything to
be embarrassed about."
Without looking at Arihiko, I take another bite of the
curry rice.
<Page104>
"I see. Well, that's true.
Lighting would strike you down if you were to complain
about the time you spent there."
Arihiko nods his head, seemingly convinced. I think his
overwhelming optimism is a truly admirable trait.
<Page105>
"I'm sorry, Tohno-kun...
I mean, did you not get along with your previous
family...?"
<Page106>
"No, that's not true. This guy has no problems with the
Arima family. They're all super nice people. Well, Mr.
Arima himself is rather scary, though.
And yet, he rejects any talk of becoming their adopted
child and runs away to my place during days off. What
are you dissatisfied with, really?"
<Page107>
"There's no reason for me to be dissatisfied with
anything. They've been good to me, I just don't want to
burden them anymore."
<Page108>
I finish my curry rice.
All that's left now is a hefty bowl of curry udon.
As you can see, Senpai is looking a little down.
<Page109>
"I'm sorry, Ciel-senpai. That was a boring story."
"T-That's not true. I'm sorry for asking you such a
strange question."
<Page110>
Senpai forces herself to act cheerful.
This topic might have been fine for a long-time friend
like Arihiko, but I'm sure it's a little awkward for
someone like Senpai.
In fact, she seems to be fidgeting as if she's
uncomfortable.
<Page111>
"Ah, I'm sorry, Senpai. But I've got to talk to Tohno
about something in private, so can you excuse us for a
sec?"
<Page112>
Arihiko blindsides us with his offhanded remark.
He's actually trying to phrase things nicely. If he was
more blunt, he'd say something like 'You're bothering
us, Senpai, could you leave?'
<Page113>
"What are you talking about? We can talk in private
anywhere, and she hasn't finished eating ye―――"
―――t.
Even though she'd been talking most of the time, Senpai
has already polished off her curry rice.
<Page114>
"No, no, I understand. Now, if you'll excuse me. I'll
leave you to it."
Senpai bows lightly to the two of us and leaves.
It's just me and Arihiko at the table.
<Page115>
"... Senpai seemed uncomfortable so it was probably
for the best. But that was a close call, wasn't it? Her
affection for you dropped."
<Page116>
"Hmm, well, that's unavoidable. I'm the one who slipped
up, so I should at least get the hate."
Arihiko slurps his chikara udon.
He was so absorbed in the conversation with Senpai that
it got cold.
<Page117>
"You were after Senpai, weren't you?"
"It's not just me, everyone's after her. Ciel-senpai is
the best at our school.# But, well, if she can't stomach
the kind of conversation we had just now then it's no
big loss. Oh yeah, I actually did have something to
talk to you about in private."
<Page118>
"......?"
Arihiko's voice is rather serious.
I split my chopsticks and start eating my curry udon.
<Page119>
"What the hell? You're creepy, acting all serious all
of a sudden. Did you do something wrong again?"
"It's not that, damn it. What I want to know is this:
what's really going on with you?"
"What do you mean?"
<Page120>
"You've been at the Arima household since primary
school, right? I don't know why, but it's been seven
years at this point. Why's your dad calling back his
disowned son all of a sudden?"
<Page121>
"I wasn't disowned.
He just asked me to leave the mansion for some reason."
<Page122>
"Look, Tohno-kun. If there was a family that randomly
kicked their child out of the house, it'd be more of a
comedy than a tragedy.
But this is one step short of horror! It's so cruel I
can't even laugh!"
<Page123>
Truth is, even before I was involved in a car accident
and hospitalized, my relationship with my father was
already strained.
The Tohnos have been a prominent family for a long
time, and their way of life is far from the norm.
All I can remember from those days was that huge,
Western-style mansion, as well as the pressure of our
family rules which, just like the mansion, seemed
frozen in time.
<Page124>
The Tohno family was also a wealthy family and
shareholders of several companies. My father, Tohno
Makihisa, was apparently a mediocre businessman, but
the assets he inherited from his grandfather were
strong enough to keep the company running smoothly.
<Page125>
An anachronistic building.
The life of the upper class, where everything revolves
around decorum and history.
As a child, I couldn't help but be bored by the
lifestyle inside that mansion.
That's why, when I was told that I would be left at the
Arima house, I accepted without much resistance.
<Page126>
I think it was for the best, in the end.
I got along well with the people of the Arima family,
and I treated my stepmother Keiko and stepfather
Fumiomi as if they were my real parents.
Tohno Shiki has always longed for a normal family, and
lived with the Arimas as though he were their actual
son.
<Page127>
I don't think there's anything to regret about that.
Except for one thing――― I can't help but feel bad
about leaving my younger sister Akiha behind at the
Tohno mansion.
<Page128>
Akiha must hate me... hate Tohno Shiki.
I mean, she has every right to hate me.
She was left alone in that huge mansion, living with my
hard-headed father.
It's easy to imagine how Akiha feels about me running
away from her.
<Page129>
"I guess you're right. It's true that if you're kicked
out of the house for no reason, you can't help but
laugh."
"Right? And on top of that, they trotted out some
hackneyed line about 'never setting foot in this
household again'. In the real world, we call that being
disowned.
I never asked before. Why'd they disown you?"
<Page130>
"........."
.........I wonder.
The problem is that I don't have the answer to that
question myself.
<Page131>
"Well, if you don't wanna talk about it, fine."
Arihiko lifts his bowl with both hands and chugs the
broth.
Lunch break is short, so I decide to follow his example
and finish my meal as quickly as possible.
