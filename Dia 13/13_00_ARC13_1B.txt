<Page1>
"........."
With Akiha gone, I finally have a chance to take stock
of my current situation.
<Page2>
It's just past ten o'clock.
Barely four hours have passed since I was attacked at
the school.
<Page3>
...My body won't move at all.
I feel like I've turned into a remote-controlled robot.
I know what I want my body to do, and I don't feel any
pain, but my limbs won't even budge.
<Page4>
"―――――."
I let out a deep sigh and calm myself down.
I'm obviously not going to have much luck if I jump
straight to trying to move the larger parts of my body,
like my arms and legs.
I should start off small, then work my way up.
I concentrate my efforts on trying to move just the
pinky finger of my right hand.
<Page5>
"―――――――."
I pour all my energy into that little finger.
I devote every fiber of my being to the goal of simply
wiggling my pinky.
<Page6>
My muscles feel like they're about to burst, but I
focus each and every one of them on that single point.
Several minutes pass. I break out in a sweat. But
eventually, my pinky finally twitches slightly.
<Page7>
"―――Alright."
I heave a huge sigh of relief.
Even if it's only my pinky, I've begun to claw back
control over my body. I can do this. I'm not just a
doll. I can move as I please.
<Page8>
Next, as though rediscovering my sense of kinesthesia,
I extend that control from my pinky finger to my ring
finger, then to my palm, my elbow, my arm, all the way
up to my shoulder.
<Page9>
"―――――――――――"
As movement returns to my limbs, so too does the pain.
<Page10>
Because my entire body had been paralyzed, I hadn't
felt it before.
It makes perfect sense that as my nerves begin to
slowly regain their function, my sense of pain will
come back as well.
<Page11>
"... ...!"
A sheen of sweat forms on my forehead.
My body is wracked by a sharp, piercing pain.
<Page12>
But if I don't regain control of my body, I won't be
able to leave this room.
I won't be able to get out of here, head for the city,
or make it to the school―――
I won't be able to catch Arcueid.
<Page13>
"―――――...!"
Fighting back my nausea, I haul myself upright in bed.
I did it... I'm sure it's going to take everything I've
got in me just to walk, but that's okay.
It's already a miracle that I managed to survive after
Roa stabbed the 'point' on my chest. It would be pretty
presumptuous of me to ask for anything more than that.
<Page14>
I take a look at the stab wound on my chest.
However―――
There's nothing there that could be mistaken for one of
those points of death.
There are two such points on my body, but neither of
them are on my chest.
<Page15>
"......Hm?"
Suddenly, I feel calm.
If someone stabs one of your points of death, you'll
die instantaneously. That's an irrefutable fact.
<Page16>
Even an immortal monster like Vlov was no exception to
that rule. But then... if that's the case, there's no
way I should have survived having one of mine pierced.
<Page17>
"...Maybe what he sees is actually something else?"
I continue to mull it over as I busy myself with
putting on my jacket.
...But then.
There's a light knock at the door, followed by Senpai
letting herself into my room.
<Page18>
"Tohno-kun?! Didn't they tell you to stay in bed?!
What on earth are you doing up and about...?!"
<Page19>
Senpai marches directly over to the bed.
"............"
I just wordlessly take in her appearance for a moment.
<Page20>
"...Hm?
What is it, Tohno-kun? Is there something on my face?"
"Yeah. You're wearing glasses."
"You're right. I guess we're matching."
<Page21>
...Seeing her smile like that clears away any doubts I
might have had that she's the same old Senpai I knew
before.
Despite saying she'd disappear from my life, she still
went out of her way to rescue me. She may have turned
out to be the sort of person that can go head-to-head
with Roa, but that behavior is just what I'd expect
from the Senpai I remember.
<Page22>
"...Thank you. You've saved me again."
"Yeah. This makes the second time I've had to get my
hands dirty. Next time you're on your own, so be
prepared."
...Second time getting her hands dirty? I was referring
to when we talked at the site of the collapse... She
must have saved me again some other time without me
even realizing it.
<Page23>
"...I see. So this was the second time.
Fine, I'll be prepared. I'll definitely get them before
they get me next time."
I stare right back at Senpai as I say that.
<Page24>
"Tohno-kun. Don't tell me that you haven't learned your
lesson."
"...I'm just a victim here, so I'm not sure how much of
a lesson there is to be learned. He came at me without
any warning. There isn't really anything I can take
away from that."
<Page25>
"Well, that's true, but... Tohno-kun, aren't you a bit
too eager?"
"............"
I don't respond to Senpai's words right away.
<Page26>
I don't know what kind of face I'm making right now.
All I know―――is that this is no time to be sitting
back and doing nothing.
<Page27>
"Senpai. Can I ask you a question?"
"No... is what I'd like to say, but I don't think that
would stop you, would it?
Go on then. I'll happily answer your questions if it
means you'll stay put. I'll keep you company and chat
for a bit."
<Page28>
Senpai takes a seat on the chair that Akiha had been
sitting on earlier.
...I'd honestly expected her to try and stop me, but I
guess I don't actually know what her true intentions
are.
<Page29>
"Is Mario here as well? And what about Noel-sensei..."
"Sensei is recovering at home. Mario is downstairs,
discussing things with Akiha-san. The two of them are
working out what to do from here, and probably trying
to probe each other for weaknesses while they're at
it."
<Page30>
Senpai says all this as though it's no concern of hers.
Even though she's connected to Mario, it seems they're
not particularly close.
<Page31>
"Alright, here goes. That guy from earlier was Roa,
wasn't he?"
"...That's right. He's the host for the current
reincarnation of Roa. The one who robbed you of your
life seven years ago: Tohno SHIKI... Did Akiha-san fill
you in on the details?"
<Page32>
"Yeah, she did. Senpai... are you getting along with
Akiha all of a sudden? I got the impression that she
despised you lot."
<Page33>
"Yeah, she despises us. Akiha-san hates the heresy
hunting profession I belong to as a whole, and doesn't
seem particularly fond of me personally either.
Well, maybe it's a little more than just your ordinary
run-of-the-mill hatred. I feel that we'll be at each
other's throats the minute this current matter is dealt
with."
...With a smile on her face, Senpai says something
rather frightening.
<Page34>
"―――I see. Well, let's put that aside for now.
Going back to Roa―――has he been living at our
school?"
<Page35>
"It seems he's used a number of places as his hideout
in the past, but for the moment, he's taken that school
building to be his stronghold.
I believe that he's been forced to take action after
Arcueid went around exterminating all of his Dead."
<Page36>
"........."
In other words, Arcueid still hasn't found Roa.
In that case―――there's still a chance I can catch
her.
<Page37>
"Tohno-kun?#"
"Ah, sorry, I was lost in thought. So, why did Roa
choose our school as his hideout in the first place?
And also, is that guy really Roa? He seems totally
different from the person I'd been hearing about."
<Page38>
"Yes, anything you've heard before doesn't necessarily
still apply.
Roa is a reincarnating vampire. It's only natural that
his appearance, character, and even his tastes would
change."
<Page39>
"Listen to me, Tohno-kun. The body that Roa chooses to
reincarnate into is raised as a human with their own
personality and everything. Roa can't manifest himself
unless the host reaches a sufficient level of
intellect.
It's only once that human has matured into an
individual that Roa uses them as a seedbed to bring
himself forth."
<Page40>
"Don't think of it as the host turning into Roa.
Instead, it's more as though the idea of Roa takes root
in the host, and gives rise to a whole new Roa.
And so, even after the new iteration of Roa awakens,
his behavior will continue to somewhat match that of
the host."
<Page41>
"...He's influenced by the host... so you're saying
this Roa thinks exactly the same way that SHIKI would?"
<Page42>
"I'd say it's more like fifty-fifty. Tohno SHIKI, the
target for the reincarnation, has been in a state of
delirium for the past seven years.
As a result, whenever the ego of SHIKI himself wanes,
his concept becomes closer to that of the
original―――to the first Roa. That's why he was
acting both as a reincarnation of Roa and the vampire
form of SHIKI at the same time.
This is the first time in Roa's history that something
like this has happened."
<Page43>
"In a way, the person known as Roa doesn't exist
anymore. What remains is nothing more than an
obsession, eternally chasing immortality.
The problem is that obsession contains a will, a
history, and an accumulated knowledge of wizardry."
<Page44>
"Roa doesn't care what his body gets up to so long as
it furthers his quest for immortality.
Roa will not try to stop SHIKI's will or get in the way
of his desires. Instead, he will help him satisfy those
desires. This is because if the host's unfinished
business is taken care of, then that vessel will belong
completely to Roa."
<Page45>
"...SHIKI's desires..."
"Yes. It's likely that he prioritized killing you above
all else, even above remaining hidden from Arcueid."
"...Hm?
SHIKI's objective was to kill me? But why?"
<Page46>
"...That's a good question. I can't say for sure, but
it seems that Tohno SHIKI thought  were the one who
killed ."
"That's totally backwards. I'm the one who got killed
back then."
<Page47>
"But you're still alive. SHIKI's the one who ended up
dead. As a result, you ended up becoming Tohno Shiki,
right?
After SHIKI was punished at the hands of the Tohno
family, he was miraculously revived. Even so, he
couldn't just go back home again. He no longer had a
place he could return to.
After all, the eldest son of the Tohno family was alive
and well, living with his sister, Akiha-san."
<Page48>
"In a way, you killed the person that was formerly
Tohno SHIKI. You stole everything from him, even his
home.
SHIKI was being kept locked up somewhere by Tohno
Makihisa, so it's pretty easy to imagine how he'd feel
about you living freely in his place."
<Page49>
"...So to SHIKI, I'm just an impostor who's using his
name to impersonate him."
"Correct. I believe SHIKI hated you more than anything
else in this world."
<Page50>
I don't like that this is how things turned out either,
but I doubt that matters to SHIKI.
To him, I'm simply an impostor worthy of hatred.
He's a man whose place in this world was stolen away by
an outsider.
<Page51>
That hatred never went away. It only grew larger and
larger over the course of those seven long years.
...So that's how it is.
Given all that, it makes sense for killing me to be the
first thing he'd want to do.
<Page52>
"―――But you know, I was the one who was killed,
Senpai."
"Tohno... kun?"
<Page53>
That's right. I had something taken away from me, too.
I would have been ten years old back then. The Shiki
who had lived up until that point was wiped away
without a trace.
<Page54>
I have no memories of my childhood from before the age
of ten.
Although I never had the desire to meet my real
parents, the memories I've lost were probably important
to me.
The child with an unknown surname, the child known only
as Shiki, no longer exists.
<Page55>
"Tohno-kun.# You mustn't let hatred be the reason you
fight."
Senpai must have picked up on something worrying in my
muttering, as she gives me a word of advice.
But I'm afraid that concern is completely misplaced,
Senpai.
<Page56>
"It's not like that. I have a different reason for
killing Roa."
"Huh? You mean, you don't hate him...?"
<Page57>
"I'd be lying if I said I didn't, but that doesn't
really have any bearing on anything. I have other
things on my mind than hate.
But even putting all that aside, I still can't leave
Roa to his own devices. If I do, then there's someone
who's liable to go off on her own and do something
incredibly reckless.
...Yeah. That's why I need to get going. After all, I
promised that I would help her to the very end."
<Page58>
...That's right.
I can't just laze around here doing nothing at a time
like this.
Even though she was suffering from an equally severe
pain this entire time, she still put on that bright and
carefree attitude for me.
<Page59>
"...I don't get it. Why do you want to help her so
badly? Arcueid is a vampire. Doesn't that make her
completely unlike you?"
<Page60>
"That doesn't matter. I'm helping her because she's
. It doesn't matter whether she's a human or
some sort of monster―――"
Actually, I should probably avoid the word 'monster'.
She'd definitely get upset about it later.
<Page61>
".... Uh, even if she was a mermaid, it wouldn't
change anything. That's how deeply I've fallen in love
with who she is."
<Page62>
I look Senpai dead in the eyes and tell her how I feel.
She puts her hands to her cheeks. It seems she's
blushing for some reason.
<Page63>
"....
It sounds like you intend to help her until the bitter
end, Tohno-kun."
<Page64>
Of course.
That's why I have to head for the school as soon as my
body recovers.
There's a chance Arcueid will find Roa and end up
fighting him.
<Page65>
If that happens, there's no guarantee that she'll make
it out alive.
I'm not sure how much help I'll be in a fight with my
body in its current state, but it's got to be better
than having her go at it alone.
<Page66>
"It's no use. Even if you could move freely, she
doesn't stand a chance against Roa as she is right
now."
"She doesn't stand a chance? ...How can you be so sure
of that, Senpai?"
<Page67>
"It's basic arithmetic.
Right now, she's struggling to hold back her vampiric
urges after they already overcame her once. As a
result, her abilities have degraded even further, to
the point where she's barely half as powerful as Roa.
Your power is also less than half that of Roa's, so
even if you were to help, you two still wouldn't be
able to hold your own against him."
<Page68>
"...Not to mention that she's already on the verge of
death.
Even though her abilities have weakened, she still
continues to hold back her urges. In human terms, it
would be like trying to move around with a collapsed
lung."
<Page69>
"Wha―――――"
What the hell?
What do you mean she's on the verge of death?
It's true that she's in a lot of pain, but there's no
way that she's actually dying...!
<Page70>
"Of course, she cannot recover so long as she uses her
strength to suppress her vampiric urges. If she wants
relief, she would have to suck someone's blood.
But Arcueid isn't going to suck anyone's blood again,
right?
That's why she will continue to drive herself closer
and closer to death the longer she chases after Roa."
"Don't give me that... don't give me that crap...!"
<Page71>
I stand up from the bed.
And then I fall to the ground with a thud.
I don't even manage to brace for impact, I just slam
into the floor like a piece of discarded garbage.
<Page72>
"―――...!"
It's so pathetic that I want to die.
Even though Arcueid is in that kind of state, here I
am, so weak that I can't even walk on my own―――
<Page73>
"Please don't push yourself.
Even though it looks like you don't have any physical
wounds, your life force is utterly drained."
<Page74>
"I believe it's an ability that Roa inherited from
SHIKI.
Simply by stabbing you with a knife, he shaved off the
entirety of your 'life' itself."
"...My... life...?"
<Page75>
"The unifying kinetic force that drives life... in
simple terms, energy. Everything that's alive generates
this unifying force, but the amount you can store
varies from person to person.
The amount of life force that can be taken from a
single person is not infinite. There's a limit. If all
of someone's accumulated energy is snatched away at
once, they will cease all vital activity."
<Page76>
...Life.
Life that brings movement to life.
<Page77>
"You're saying... that it's what keeps things
alive...?"
"Let's see. Strictly speaking, I wouldn't say that
you're  without it. It's more like a vehicle that
won't move anymore because it's run out of gas.
The engine isn't broken, so if you just put some more
fuel in, it'll start right up again."
<Page78>
After she finishes talking, Senpai helps me up off the
ground and tries to put me back to bed.
<Page79>
"...Enough. I'm not about to go back to lying down."
<Page80>
"Geez. How can you say that when you can't even stand
on your own?
If you don't want to lie down, then at least stay like
this."
With a firm push, Senpai makes me take a seat on the
bed.
<Page81>
"......."
I'm out of breath just from sitting down on the bed.
<Page82>
...Damnit.
I'm never going to make it to the school at this rate.
Even if I did manage to meet up with Arcueid, I'd just
end up holding her back...!
<Page83>
"It's okay. You don't have to fight anymore.
If you're worried about Roa, he'll be taken care of in
a few days."
"Taken care of... what do you mean...?"
<Page84>
"Now that we've identified Roa's host, we can finally
request assistance from the Vatican... uhh, our
headquarters.
We have Mario here this time as well, so in about three
days we should have plenty of Executors headed our way,
which will spell the end for Roa.
...In the end, the same thing will happen all over
again, but at least we'll be able to take care of this
generation's Roa."
<Page85>
...Three days.
Three whole days...?
<Page86>
"...That's no good. I can't wait that long. There's a
chance that Arcueid will fight Roa tonight.
If that happens―――then none of that will make any
difference...!"
<Page87>
I put strength into my legs.
Doing my best to disguise my labored breathing, I stand
up from the bed.
<Page88>
"...Senpai. Where's... my knife?"
"I'm holding onto it―――but do you really think I'm
going to hand it over to you?"
"...I don't. But you shouldn't go picking up other
people's things.
Didn't they teach you, 'Thou shalt not steal'?"
<Page89>
Acknowledging my argument, Senpai produces my knife
from her habit.
<Page90>
"This knife belongs to you, so I'm returning it.
But are you really going back to the school?"
"―――I've said it several times now.
Before Arcueid has the chance to find Roa, I'll―――"
<Page91>
I'll kill him.
If SHIKI is after my life, then we're destined to fight
to the death sooner or later.
Given that―――I'll take the initiative and go kill
him to protect Arcueid.
<Page92>
"So you're going out in that state.
...I really don't understand you at all. Could you
please tell me the reason why you're so obsessed with
her? If you do, I promise I won't get in your way."
<Page93>
...Senpai asks me the same question from before.
As I put strength into my trembling knees, I reexamine
my own feelings one more time, as though to take from
them the strength I need to get out of here.
<Page94>
"――――I――――"
The reason why I want to save her.
Is it because I love her?
Is it because I enjoy being with her?
<Page95>
...Yeah, those things both go without saying.
But there's a deeper reason, one that I will absolutely
never let go of.
<Page96>
"...She's all by herself. I just can't leave her alone.
That's probably my reason."
"―――You're lying. You wouldn't be throwing your life
away for something like that. Tell me the real reason,
Tohno-kun.
...I can't accept that sort of answer."
<Page97>
"No, that really is the reason.
...She's been on her own up until now, never even
knowing that life could be full of fun.
All this time, she was alone like an idiot.
Isn't that just too sad? I can't stand seeing someone
live such a meaningless life. That's why―――"
<Page98>
That's why I just wanted to tell her.
I wanted to tell her how many things there are to do in
this world, most of them absolutely pointless or
meaningless.
But even a child knows that the joy in life comes from
doing those things anyway. I wanted her to know―――
<Page99>
"...I just wanted to show her.
She was smiling so ecstatically back then that I wanted
to show her how that happiness is something that's
always within her reach."
<Page100>
"This world has so much more to offer―――
So many things that can make all your pointless
troubles disappear. I wanted to bring her to see them
all, over and over again.
I wanted her to be able to feel like these ordinary
experiences really are just everyday occurrences―――I
wanted to make her happy."
<Page101>
I didn't want to do it out of pity.
I simply longed for things be that way.
For her to always be able to smile.
After all, her smile is a truly beautiful sight.
<Page102>
"Isn't that just the way it is?
I have to make her even happier to make up for all the
time she's spent on her own. It would be unforgivable
not to balance out that loneliness.
Besides, it's so incredibly simple for her to stop
being alone. It's totally foolish to even worry about
things like that."
<Page103>
...That's right, it's way too simple.
All you have to do is talk to someone, and do the
things that you want to do.
<Page104>
"...I'm sure that anyone could have done it.
Anyone could have made her happy.
So yeah―――it's true that there's no need for me to
struggle on with this pathetic body of mine. There are
plenty of people out there that could take care of her
loneliness."
<Page105>
...I know that.
I know that, but I just can't accept it.
<Page106>
"―――But, I can't.
I can't leave her to someone else, and I can't part
ways with her like this.
...For me, there's nobody else."
<Page107>
And now a terrible person like me―――
A person who gave up on everything, and died like a
dog―――
is asking for so much.
<Page108>
"...I'm in love with Arcueid."
As a man, I love anything and everything about her.
<Page109>
"But above all, I want to bring her happiness with my
own hands. If that means giving up my life, then so be
it.
I don't want her to disappear like this... that's all
there is to it, Senpai."
<Page110>
Yeah, that's all there is to it.
I want to place Arcueid's life above even my own.
I can now say with conviction that this is the reason
why my eyes exist.
<Page111>
"You really think anyone else could do that?# Don't be
absurd. Nobody else possibly could. I'm pretty sure
you're the only person in the world capable of saying
something like that."
<Page112>
Senpai breathes out a heavy sigh and shrugs her
shoulders.
<Page113>
"―――Senpai?"
"....# I got a little worked up.
Surely she's happy enough after all that?"
<Page114>
Her mouth curls into a wry smile.
She spoke those words in a gentle voice.
<Page115>
―――And then.
I hear the sound of tree branches rustling outside the
window.
<Page116>
"...Huh?"
"Ah, no need to panic. It was just her leaving.# I'd
been feeling as though something was amiss for a while
now, it seems my suspicions were correct."
Senpai glances over toward the window.
<Page117>
"But it really isn't like her to prioritize you over
Roa... Well, I guess if she's decided to go take care
of him, I should go deliver the finishing blow."
<Page118>
"W-Why?!
Why did Arcueid come to my room...?!"
<Page119>
"You were attacked by Roa, so she was probably worried
about you and came to see how you were doing.
She spent some time eavesdropping on our conversation,
and now she's just left to go face him."
"She's going? But why?!"
<Page120>
"Isn't that obvious? If I had heard what you just said,
I would have done the same thing.#
...
Yeah, I'm jealous, but at the same time, I feel
sorry for her."
"―――But still, why―――"
<Page121>
"You said you wanted to save Arcueid.
But she doesn't want you to get mixed up in this.
So there's only one solution."
<Page122>
"Now then. You must have given up by now, right?
No matter how hard you try, you'll never be able to
catch up to her. Please leave the rest to us and take
it easy..."
<Page123>
"―――Don't give me that crap!"
In a fit of rage, I grab Senpai by her collar.
Simply doing that triggered a bout of dizziness, but
that doesn't matter right now.
<Page124>
"You asked for my reason knowing that this would
happen, didn't you―――?!"
"...No. I never knew that you saw her that way.
...I admit, this was an error on my part."
<Page125>
Senpai's expression is utterly unflinching.
She stares back at me, her eyes calm even as I grab her
by the collar.
<Page126>
"―――――――――"
...Doing this won't solve anything.
Arcueid has already left.
This isn't the time for me to be blaming Senpai.
<Page127>
"―――I'm going after her. Take me with you."
"Do you really expect me to listen to threats from
someone in your condition?"
No, of course not.
<Page128>
"Like I care. If you don't do as I say, I'll fuck you
up."
"――――"
<Page129>
Senpai's expression is thrown into disarray.
That composed face of hers gives way to shock, followed
by what appears to be deep thought.
And then...
