"........."
An unnatural collapse.
The part of the walkway between me and the opposing
school building has crumbled away, as though it had
been made of an entirely different material to the
surrounding building.
Pushing through the pain in my head and the numbness of
my body, I head for the stairs.
<Page2>
Under the moonlight.
The courtyard has been transformed into a sea of
rubble.
From deep within, I can hear something clattering
around as it moves.
<Page3>
"........."
How pathetically he clings to life.
My body is on the verge of collapse, but I drag myself
up and over the heaps of rubble.
<Page4>
"――― ..."
It's as though the lower half of Roa's body doesn't
even exist.
That part of him no longer regenerates, almost like
it's been doomed to a fate of 'nonexistence'.
<Page5>
Even so, the upper half of his body has managed to
crawl out from under the rubble. He's still moving
around as though the death of his body doesn't even
affect him.
His life force is truly something to be admired.
<Page6>
"What the hell―――was that?"
He writhes, drenched, in a pool of his own blood.
Is he going to reconstruct himself? Surely he will.
I see, he isn't able to do that again just yet. If he
can't resurrect or regenerate, then he ought to be able
to make do by crafting a stand-in. What a vampire-like
notion. I'm sure that in a few minutes he'd be able to
construct himself a prosthetic to temporarily take the
place of his lower body.
<Page7>
Picking my way across the rubble, I walk over to him.
<Page8>
"―――Shi...ki."
He raises his head and glares at me.
His eyes are so brimming with hatred that it feels as
though it could all come spilling out at any moment.
<Page9>
"You monster―――you monster, you monster, you
monster...!"
A hateful cry of resentment.
His lower body begins to rapidly grow back.
The blood that had soaked the rubble around us is
absorbed back into his body, as though I were watching
a tape being rewound.
<Page10>
"Which one of us?"
Putting my thoughts into words, I relax my grip on the
knife.
His point is slightly to the right of his heart.
I plunge the blade in with a soft thud.
It feels like cutting through paper. The sensation of
death is not particularly dull, but nor is it all that
special.
<Page11>
'Ah―――'
He gasps lightly.
This is a man who has experienced death many times,
even if only imperfectly.
He understands this feeling better than most people.
<Page12>
"There's nothing to be scared of. This is a journey you
should be intimately familiar with. If there's anything
different, it would be only this."
<Page13>
         "―――This time, you won't come back."
<Page14>
I pull out my knife and turn away.
His life is already over.
It came to an end swifter and easier than you could
close your eyes.
<Page15>
"...."
My consciousness begins to slip away.
If my body is at its limit, then my mind is already
long past it.
<Page16>
I think Arcueid warned me about this...
About how I shouldn't look too closely at death. About
how if I push myself too hard, the blood vessels in my
brain will burn out, or something like that.
<Page17>
"........."
―――None of that matters anymore.
If I was prepared to end up like this―――
If I was this prepared to turn into a cripple, I should
have killed Roa much sooner.
Because if I had, then she would...
still be alive right now――――
<Page18>
"......?!"
I've fallen. I'm lying in a heap on the ground.
I feel a pain in my ankle.
When I look back, I see――――
<Page19>
A monster, crawling using only his right arm.
<Page20>
"Y-Y-Y...You―――――"
He slowly drags himself on top of my fallen body.
"I...i ...i'm ... , f... Fa... faD――――"
He wraps his blood-soaked arm around my neck.
<Page21>
"Wha... DiD... yOu―――I'm, faDing, how, dId, YoU, Ki,
kikiKIkiKikI, kiLL, m-m, m-m-m-m-m-m-me――――"
He opens his knife-like mouth, readying himself to bite
into my throat.
<Page22>
"I, wOn'T, DiE, we ArE, cOnnecT, ed. iF, i, mOvE, inTo,
YoU, mY, chain OF existence, won't be DESTROYED...!"
His fangs―――
Plunge into my throat.
<Page23>
"Ah―――――――"
He's gone.
Roa's body is torn to pieces in an instant.
<Page24>
", that was way too close."
There in front of me―――
Stands Senpai, slightly out of breath, a collection of
blades grasped in her hand.
<Page25>
"Now then. With that, I was the one who killed this
person."
"......"
I don't... entirely understand what Senpai is trying to
do here.
<Page26>
"Like I said, I'm the one who killed Roa.
That achievement, that responsibility, and everything
else all belong to me. I won't let you take credit or
blame for any part of this.
I'd appreciate it if you went back home empty-handed
and ashamed at how you weren't able to do anything."
<Page27>
Senpai places her hands on her hips as she bosses me
around.
...That's really unfair.
Just when I thought I'd never be able to smile again,
she makes me crack a bitter smile.
<Page28>
"...Senpai. That's sophistry."
"Sophistry, huh. But if it's a kind lie, I think that's
okay. Even if it's hypocritical, doesn't it make you
feel like there's some kind of salvation out there?"
<Page29>
"――――――"
Those words seem familiar.
They remind me a lot of what that woman said to me,
back when I'd told her that I hated talking about
what-ifs.
<Page30>
"...I guess you're right. I feel like―――there might
still be a chance at salvation out there yet."
Something like that really would be wonderful.
<Page31>
"...Ah, but right now your body takes top priority!
Are you okay, Tohno-kun? Were you bitten?!"
Senpai tends to my fallen body.
<Page32>
"――――――"
My consciousness fades.
My brain signals that it can't take any more, and that
it needs to rest.
<Page33>
"...Tohno-kun... Tohno-kun...... hey...!"
...It gradually grows further away.
My self-condemnation, my regret.
The headache tormenting my brain, the warmth that
remains in my hands, all of it.
It all slips away like a receding fever.
<Page34>
"――――――"
...I have a memory of staring up at this same moon long
ago.
With my eyes still open―――
My consciousness shuts down completely.
Like a monitor that's been switched off, it vanishes
without even a trace of a lingering afterimage.
