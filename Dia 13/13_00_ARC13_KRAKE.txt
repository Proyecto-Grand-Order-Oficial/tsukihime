<Page1>
Leaving Tohno Shiki behind, the Executor infiltrates
the darkened school building.
This is no headlong assault. It's a clandestine
operation.
She's already well accustomed to raiding enemy
territory.
<Page2>
To Ciel the Executor, slaying vampires is a matter of
professionalism, not of pride.
The thought of barreling in through the front door
would be insane to her, as would the idea of
challenging him to a fair fight.
<Page3>
"――――――"
She propels herself along like a creeping shadow.
Her advance is silent of course, but that's not
all―――her scent, her body heat, her heartbeat...
Every vital process that could give her away has been
sealed off from the world.
She even goes so far as to completely empty her mind.
<Page4>
There exist some vampires who are able to detect the
ripples of cause and effect brought about by an
intruder's thoughts.
It's not clear whether Michael Roa Valdamjong has
reached that level as of tonight, but a True Ancestor
like Arcueid can almost certainly exert that amount of
dominion over the area.
<Page5>
If Arcueid realizes that Ciel has infiltrated the
school,# then that information will also become known to
her opponent, Roa.
If that happens, then a surprise attack is off the
table.
<Page6>
In order to avoid that scenario, Ciel turns herself
into a machine.
An automaton that only follows the orders she's laid
out in advance, unthinking, unswerving.
<Page7>
Ciel mechanically advances on the blind spot that will
spell Roa's inevitable death.
Through Detection Magecraft, she can sense what's going
on around her.
<Page8>
Roa lies in wait in the gym, surrounded by the vast
number of Magecraft Formulas he's inscribed.
Arcueid is moving toward the gym through the connecting
hallway.
Sparks crackle across the concrete face of the
building.
<Page9>
Od... the magical energy that Roa has been gathering up
until now―――
is jockeying for supremacy with Arcueid's own magical
energy.
If Ciel hadn't sealed off her thoughts, it would have
reminded her of a powder keg.
The concentration of magical energy is almost electric,
and even the slightest movement could set off a
reaction that would blow an intruder sky high.
<Page10>
"――――――"
'Will Tohno Shiki make his way through there?'
Even a thought like that won't present itself now.
<Page11>
She is nothing more than a killing machine, making her
way from the courtyard to the rooftop.
Not even the appearance of Roa himself would be enough
to shock her out of her trance.
In addition―――
<Page12>
"――――――Huh?"
Over there.
Over there is some that makes her doubt her own
eyes, a ghoulish herald of death.
<Page13>
The abnormal creature clings to the wall.
Even for Ciel, who has dispatched countless Dead
Apostles and other monsters, this grotesque beast is
something she has never even heard of, let alone seen.
<Page14>
Its outer skin is as hard as bark, yet still as supple
as leather.
Its abdomen is distended and misshapen.
Six legs protrude from that abdomen.
Claws and tusks like those of a colossal dinosaur jut
from the lump on its right shoulder.
<Page15>
Its lower body resembles a spider.
Its upper body resembles a human.
That said, the eight eyes give off a distinctly
spider-like impression.
But what's most bizarre of all―――
<Page16>
"――――――"
Is the murky and jumbled 'consciousness' being given
off by that aberration, which she can't pin down as
either hostility or outright bloodlust.
<Page17>
Faced by it, she senses a murderous impulse strong
enough to make one curl up and accept death.
Faced by it, she senses hostility so extreme that
goosebumps break out all over her body.
But she has never run across a consciousness like this
before. She has no way to analyze it.
This thing probably isn't even written of in the
Church's documents.
<Page18>
No ordinary human can fathom the origin of such a
'consciousness'.
It reminds her of an oil painting from a certain
renowned artist.
A single-minded depiction of a city enveloped by the
blue gloom of night, daubed over with the moon and
stars.
It's as if she's been transported to an entirely
different dimension.
<Page19>
"―――――――――"
Without realizing it, Ciel begins breathing again.
All thoughts relating to Roa, Shiki, and Arcueid vanish
from her mind.
<Page20>
The only thing that fills her now is a primordial fear.
A very human fear, the sort a girl would naturally have
before she learned of the existence of monsters, before
she became an Executor.
Namely―――an unbearable revulsion for creepy things.
<Page21>
The school building shudders and shakes.
Its steel frame groans under the stress caused by the
magical energy that had filled the air detonating in a
chain reaction.
This isn't the work of that creature.
It's the start of the fight between Arcueid and Roa.
<Page22>
"Shit―――"
She was only a few seconds too slow, but it cost her
dearly.
Realizing that she's lost her chance to assassinate
Roa―――
<Page23>
She immediately switches gears, focusing on her new
target.
<Page24>
"[ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00]―――"
It lunges. It isn't clear whether the creature is a bug
or a beast, but its three-meter-long body comes
skittering across the face of the building all the
same.
<Page25>
The shaking of the building doesn't seem to faze it at
all.
Now only eight meters away, the unknown monster aims
its collection of disgusting arms at Ciel.
<Page26>
"...!"
The arms lash out like whips.
Recognizing the stench they give off as that of a Dead
Apostle, Ciel manages to regain her composure.
<Page27>
"So this is a new species of Ghoul...!"
Roa must have stationed it here to stand guard against
her.
It makes complete sense when you think about it.
Still standing on the ground, Ciel takes stock of the
enormous Ghoul clinging to the wall.
<Page28>
Although its entire body bristles with lethal weapons,
there are only two that deserve special attention.
The tusks sprouting from the lump on its shoulder, and
its enormous left arm.
The tusks on its shoulder aren't intended for close
combat.
Instead, they're almost certainly―――
<Page29>
As she suspected.
They're missiles, designed to shoot prey from a
distance.
If a projectile that massive scores a direct hit on her
at that speed, her body will be smashed to smithereens.
<Page30>
Even as she darts upwards and away, the arms continue
their single-minded pursuit.
Entirely unperturbed by the hail of blows raining down
around her, the Executor leaps away to the rooftop in
the span of a single breath.
<Page31>
The enormous Ghoul comes scurrying for the rooftop in
pursuit.
Its six legs send it gliding across the ground just as
smoothly as it had scaled the face of the building.
<Page32>
"...It's surprisingly fast for its size, but..."
As she studies its movements, she begins to piece
together her plan of attack.
<Page33>
That enormous Ghoul is like a mobile gun emplacement.
Its elastic right arm, along with the tusks that
protrude from its shoulder―――the next volley of
which is already beginning to grow back―――must be
its forward-firing weapons.
<Page34>
A body tailored to excel at long-range warfare.
However, that doesn't necessarily mean it's weak when
it comes to close combat.
If Ciel were to rush in to attack it head-on, that
gigantic left arm would steamroll any defense she might
be able to muster.
<Page35>
"But then again..."
That'll only happen if it can hit her.
The enormous left arm goes against the entire concept
of that Ghoul.
It throws the whole body off balance, and actually ends
up hindering its own movement.
If that left arm had been identical to its right, it
would have made for a much sturdier mobile fortress. It
may have even been able to corner Ciel with its
long-range offensive.
<Page36>
"[ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00]―――!"
"―――!"
<Page37>
Its arms whip out at her once more.
Dodging each of them by a hair's breadth, the Executor
continues to surge forward.
<Page38>
The fear that had gripped her mere moments ago has
vanished completely.
She might still be in the dark about the true nature or
origin of this enemy, but she's at least managed to get
a handle on its fighting capabilities.
Even though it's an entirely novel threat, there's
nothing to suggest it's capable of taking her down.
<Page39>
There's no risk that she'll lose to that Ghoul.
She has complete confidence that the armaments she has
on her are more than sufficient to exterminate it.
If there is a problem, it would be―――
<Page40>
"Time―――"
The enemy is wholly unknown.
Its abilities rival those of Greater Dead Apostles.
Taking all that into account, it seems unlikely that
it'll die after only one or two 'judgments'.
Just how long will it take to kill it so utterly that
it can no longer regenerate?
"―――Ten minutes. I can't afford to take any
longer...!"
<Page41>
The Executor's magecraft scorches the Ghoul's body.
Despite taking a lighting strike that would have
obliterated the body of even the largest of animals
head on, the Ghoul leaps backwards and continues to
engage in battle with the Executor.
<Page42>
The Executor grits her teeth as it becomes clear that
the Ghoul is tougher than it looks.
Her attack has only gone a small way toward fully
killing this enemy.
As of now, she has no way of knowing just how her
actions will affect the outcome of what happens here
tonight.
