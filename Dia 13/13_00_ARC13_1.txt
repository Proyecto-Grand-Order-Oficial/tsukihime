――――For as long as I can remember, I've felt
alienated from my family.
It's a thought that's been with me ever since I was a
child.
From the moment I was sent away from the Tohno
household to live with the Arimas.
No, on second thought, I felt this way long before that
happened.
<Page2>
I've never had to ask myself why it is I feel that way.
I started out in this world alone. There were people
around me that looked like my parents, so I simply
tried my best to behave like their child.
I think that house with the old tatami floors may have
been my first home.
After some incident happened, I was taken from there to
a giant Western-style mansion.
<Page3>
...At that mansion was a pair of siblings, a brother
and a sister, who were around the same age as me#.
I felt that I got along really well with them.
However, I always got the sense there was a wall
between me and their father.
I tried really hard.
I went to great lengths in order for us to become an
ideal family.
I wanted him to believe that we were father and son,
even if we weren't related by blood.
<Page4>
But even that came to an abrupt end.
After getting involved in a major accident, I was taken
to the hospital.
No one came to visit me, and my eyes went haywire.
I'd been alone before, and in the end, I was alone
again.
I began to feel as though I should simply stay like
that and fade away.
<Page5>
Or at least, I did until I crossed paths with that
magician, beautiful as the clear blue sky.
<Page6>
......A nostalgic dream.
<Page7>
"I'm――――alive."
I mumble those words in a daze.
Although I'm unable to lift even a single finger, I'm
at least able to speak.
<Page8>
...The knife has been removed, and a bandage has been
wrapped around my chest.
As I come to my senses, I realize that this is my
bedroom.
<Page9>
"...Nii-san? It appears you've come to."
"Akiha―――so you were here."
It seems like Akiha was sitting next to my bed and
nursing me.
<Page10>
"Akiha, you―――"
I stare at Akiha, unable to fully grasp the situation.
She awkwardly averts her gaze.
<Page11>
"...Well... about this wound..."
I can't tell her I got it from that guy―――from
<SHIKI|R o a  >.
<Page12>
Actually, hold on, how is Akiha so calm about the fact
that I received a wound like this in the first place?
You'd normally send someone with a knife sticking out
of them straight to the hospital.
<Page13>
"...It's okay. Just make yourself comfortable.
I got the gist of what happened from those people."
"Those people... You mean Senpai?"
Akiha nods, her eyes never leaving the floor.
<Page14>
"........."
...This is a problem.
She says she got the gist of it, but just how much does
she actually know?
Since I don't know exactly how much Senpai has told
her, I can't afford to ask any careless questions.
<Page15>
"...So, Akiha. Where's Senpai right now?"
"I granted her use of one of the guest rooms, so she's
probably resting as we speak.
I wouldn't normally let such a miscreant inside the
mansion, but I can't deny that she saved you. It would
be rude to turn her away."
<Page16>
" ..."
Akiha must be in an even less forgiving mood than usual
if she's pulling out words like 'miscreant'.
<Page17>
"But leaving that aside, Nii-san.
That wound on your chest is from SHIKI, isn't it?"
She doesn't beat around the bush.
Akiha jumps straight to the heart of the matter.
<Page18>
"I told you that I heard the gist of what happened,
didn't I?
...Though, even if I hadn't, it'd be clear from one
look at you what had transpired."
<Page19>
"――――"
My throat seizes up from a combination of shock and
nerves.
The way she said that makes it sound like she's known
about SHIKI the whole time.
<Page20>
"Akiha, you... knew about SHIKI?"
"Yes, I knew. In fact, it was  I knew that I
called you back to the mansion."
<Page21>
"...H-Hold on a second. What do you mean by that?
I mean... To tell the truth, I still can't make heads
or tails of all this.
I was sure that there had to have been another child
around back when you and I were kids. Things just
didn't add up otherwise.
But when I asked you about it, you――――"
<Page22>
You told me there hadn't been a third child.
<Page23>
"In regards to that, I apologize.
I've... been lying to you the entire time. Even in this
situation... even though I knew it would end up like
this, I still continued to deceive you."
<Page24>
"...So there  three of us.
But then, why did he..."
<Page25>
...Why did he disappear from the Tohno mansion seven
years ago?
My memories from back then are pretty hazy.
That other kid... All I can really remember is that he
was a boy around my age, and that the two of us always
played around together.
Every now and then, we would go behind our father's
back and go outside to play with Akiha.
<Page26>
And yet, I don't remember anything else.
The reason for his disappearance.
The fact that his name was pronounced the same as mine.
I've completely forgotten just about everything.
<Page27>
"...I don't get it.
There's only one thing I do remember, and
that's――――"
<Page28>
The scene I saw in that forest clearing.
Ever since I returned to the mansion, I've been haunted
by the image of that hot summer's day, like some sort
of waking dream.
<Page29>
Akiha was there. I was there.
And in front of me, the corpse of another boy covered
in blood.
"......The corpse?"
<Page30>
...Wait. I'm sure I remember that vampire saying
something about this.
That he 'returned the favor of being killed'.
Then, does that mean――――
<Page31>
"That dream―――Did I, really―――"
Did I really kill him?
Is that why he suddenly disappeared? Is the reason I
forgot all about it because it was such an inconvenient
truth...?
<Page32>
"Akiha, I――――"
"No, you're wrong. You didn't kill anyone.
What you remember is what Father... what Tohno Makihisa
led you to believe."
"Father... did that?"
<Page33>
...That seems like way too much of a stretch.
Why would the old man tell me something like that...?
<Page34>
"What do you mean by that?
Akiha, you knew everything? Even what happened seven
years ago? About SHIKI?"
"...Yes. I didn't want you to remember anything about
SHIKI. I'd hoped for you to remain blissfully ignorant
forever, if at all possible."
<Page35>
"...Alas,# it seems that I have failed.
Keeping his existence hidden... was an impossible task
to begin with."
She chuckles derisively at herself.
Turning to look me straight in the eye, Akiha begins to
speak.
<Page36>
"Nii-san. You've heard from those people that the Tohno
family is a special bloodline, correct? This may be
hard to believe, but the Tohno blood is mixed with that
of something non-human.
...At least, that's what Father drilled into me for my
entire childhood."
<Page37>
"Of course, I didn't really believe it initially.
But then, something happened that left me no choice but
to accept it.
...The incident seven years ago―――when you were
killed by SHIKI."
"...You're saying... I was killed... by SHIKI...?"
<Page38>
Akiha nods silently.
...But that can't be right.
If anything, it's the opposite.
The collapsed, blood-soaked figure was SHIKI, not me...
And I could have sworn that guy mentioned something
about payback for being killed...?
<Page39>
"...The details vary from person to person, but as a
general rule, the deviant blood that runs in the
members of the Tohno family grows stronger with age.
This blood isn't exactly something you could consider
good.
The xenogenetic material mixed in with the Tohno
bloodline carries a survival instinct different to that
of humans. If you consider the human part of that
mixture to be reason, then that foreign part would be
instinct, or the id."
<Page40>
"...Akiha, that's..."
"...I know. This may be a lot to take in all at once,
but just be quiet and listen for now."
<Page41>
"However, it is only in old age that members of the
Tohno bloodline cease to be human.
There had never been a case of someone inverting during
childhood, at least not until my brother... until SHIKI
came along."
<Page42>
"The abilities possessed by the members of the Tohno
family vary from person to person. There are those
whose outward appearance barely changes at all, and
those whose bodies change drastically.
―――SHIKI is a perfect example of the latter."
<Page43>
"The latter... you mean that his physical
characteristics changed...?"
"...That's right. As for why SHIKI went mad at such a
young age, I haven't got a clue.
His inversion that day came completely out of the blue.
And when it happened, the one he attacked... was you,
Nii-san."
<Page44>
"SHIKI... attacked me...?"
.
The scar on my chest throbs.
<Page45>
"It happened in that clearing in the forest.
SHIKI slashed you across the chest, and you were on the
verge of death.
That's when Father rushed in and stopped him."
<Page46>
"...Once SHIKI had lost all reason, the only way to
stop him was to kill him. The head of the Tohno family
has the duty of disposing of inverted family members.
All this to say―――the image you have of SHIKI
covered in blood is likely from after Father had dealt
with him."
<Page47>
"―――――――"
...There's something I'm still forgetting.
Something else happened back then. I feel like there's
something extremely important that I'm missing, but I
just can't remember what it is.
<Page48>
...And there's something else.
I'm convinced that somewhere within those memories I
can no longer recall, I took the life of  with
my own two hands.
Regardless of what anyone tells me, I feel like I
killed someone inside that forest―――
<Page49>
"...Fortunately, you were able to survive by some
miracle.
After that, it is as you remember. We took you to a
hospital under the false pretext that you had been
involved in an accident."
"――――"
<Page50>
"...It was because of that incident that I was chosen
to be the next family head.
A person who has inverted even once can never be
allowed to be the next head of the family.
With SHIKI no longer fit to be the successor, I was
raised to become the next head as the only other person
related to Father by blood."
<Page51>
...I see.
So that's why the responsibility of being the family
head fell to Akiha... wait, hold on.
<Page52>
"Akiha. That can't be right. I mean, the one that
inverted was SHIKI, right?
Wouldn't that make me―――well, normal?"
<Page53>
"...I'm surprised.
Nii-san, do you really not find any of this hard to
believe...?"
<Page54>
"Come on. There's no way you'd make something like this
up, and, well, I guess I'm sorta used to hearing things
like this by now.
...A-Anyway, let's get back on track. I want to know
why you were chosen as the head... and why I was sent
to live with the Arimas."
<Page55>
"...The answer is simple.
You could never have succeeded the Tohno family in the
first place.
To think that you've managed to forget even that...# 
If
only we could have kept up that façade forever."
"...Akiha...?"
<Page56>
"...Nii-san, you're not a true member of the Tohno
family.
You were simply adopted by Father on a whim because you
happened to share a name with my brother."
――――――――――――Huh?
<Page57>
"...There was you, there was me, and then there was
SHIKI.
We were raised as if we were truly brothers and
sisters.
You and SHIKI got along so well back then that it
actually made me a little envious... But everything
went to hell when SHIKI turned into that thing."
<Page58>
"Father disposed of SHIKI in secret. However, he
couldn't have it become publicly known that he'd lost
the eldest son of the Tohno family.
I'm sure you understand that the Tohno family name
carries a lot of weight in society.
As such... it would have been imprudent to make it
known that his eldest son, his heir, had passed away."
<Page59>
"That's when Father hit upon an idea.
If he treated Tohno Shiki, the one SHIKI had killed, as
his own child, then he could pretend that SHIKI, who
had ceased to be human, was an adopted child that had
passed away in an accident.
...That was the moment when you and SHIKI switched
places.
The one who had been killed survived, and the one who
had killed died. Such is the relationship between the
two of you."
<Page60>
"But then... If I'm not your brother, if I'm not part
of the Tohno family―――"
Of course, I'm not a member of the Arima family either.
"Then―――just who am I, and where did I come from?"
<Page61>
"I'm sorry... no one can answer that question anymore.
You―――the child known as Shiki, no longer exists.
The child known as Shiki died seven years ago. I do not
mean that he physically died, but rather that his
existence was erased. His records, his past, his home,
and even his memories are no longer of this earth.
Seven years ago, when you switched places with Tohno
SHIKI, Father... got rid of absolutely everything."
<Page62>
―――――――――――#Huh?
"That's why... you were entrusted to the Arima family.
In order to keep up appearances, the eldest son of the
Tohno family had to be kept alive. But because you
weren't truly related by blood, you could never become
the heir."
<Page63>
"Father banished you to the Arima household under the
pretense that your health had declined as a result of
the accident... He ordered me to never let you back
into the Tohno family."
<Page64>
...Akiha's voice is trembling.
Her head is bowed, and it seems as though she's
struggling to contain her emotions.
She must be feeling guilty toward me about all this.
<Page65>
But her feelings are misplaced. I don't hold any of
this against her at all.
Knowing she feels this way about me makes me feel
blessed, if anything.
But even so―――#there's something that I absolutely
have to ask.
<Page66>
"...It's no good. There are still two things I'm unsure
about. I need you to tell me more, Akiha. Otherwise
it's just going to keep on bugging me."
<Page67>
"Question number one. Well, I guess this one's more a
point of clarification than a question.
I understand that I'm not a real member of the Tohno
family. I also believe you when you say that the Tohno
blood isn't exactly normal.
But if both those things are true, then why are my eyes
the way they are?
...The truth is I have a bit of a strange constitution
myself, is that just a coincidence?"
<Page68>
"...I don't know. It's true that Father was not the
type of person to adopt a child on a whim―――perhaps
there was a reason why he adopted you in the first
place."
<Page69>
"I see... well, it doesn't matter to me who I really am
at this point. You don't have to worry about it either.
I'm just, well. I think I'm lucky to be alive.
By all rights, this wound should have been fatal,
right? The fact that I'm still here is a blessing in
itself."
That's right. But more importantly――――
<Page70>
"Question number two: Why is SHIKI still alive?"
"Nii-san... that's..."
<Page71>
"It doesn't make any sense for him to still be alive,
does it?
SHIKI succumbed to the Tohno blood and inverted or
whatever, right?
Once he did, he killed me, and then the old man choked
the life out of him.
But if that's what happened, there's no way he could
still be alive."
"........."
<Page72>
"I can only think of one possible explanation. If I was
somehow able to escape death, then the same must also
have been true for him.
...On second thought, it's also possible that the old
man just didn't actually kill him at all.
Even if SHIKI had gone mad, he was still his own flesh
and blood. What if, instead of killing him, he whisked
him off somewhere to try and cure him in secret? Like
how I was taken to the hospital."
<Page73>
Akiha doesn't respond.
The fact that she doesn't even try to deny it is her
strength... and also her weakness.
It's as if she's confirming that at least the broad
strokes of what I said are true.
<Page74>
"...I see. So if SHIKI had returned to normal, he
would've been brought back to the mansion as Tohno
Shiki. We're talking about the old man, after all."
"That's... that's not――――"
Akiha looks down without finishing her sentence.
<Page75>
"It's fine. It isn't your fault, and it isn't the old
man's fault. Of course, it isn't SHIKI's fault either.
...Things just happened to turn out that way. That's
all.
I just happened to be unlucky, and some crazy guy from
another country happened to take over SHIKI. The only
one who's truly in the wrong here is the one who drove
SHIKI mad."
<Page76>
Akiha continues to hang her head in silence.
...Our conversation ends here.
To be honest, I didn't really want to find out all this
stuff about myself.
But that's not what's most important right now. I need
to go and find Arcueid as soon as I possibly can.
<Page77>
"Sorry, I'm a little tired. Would you mind leaving the
room so I can sleep?"
"......Of course. If that's what you'd prefer."
Akiha heads for the door.
<Page78>
"――――Akiha.#"
I call for her to stop. There's one more thing I want
to ask her.
"What is it, Nii-san?"
<Page79>
"Well... why was it that you called me back to the
mansion? I'm... not even your real brother."
<Page80>
"...Please don't ask such foolish questions.
To me, the word 'brother' refers to you and you alone.
You may have forgotten, but I have always felt this
way, ever since we were children.
―――You were the only one I ever considered my
brother, Shiki."
Akiha leaves the room, the door swinging shut behind
her with a thud.
