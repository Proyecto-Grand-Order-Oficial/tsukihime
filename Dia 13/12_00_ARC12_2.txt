I walk down the deserted hallway.
The fiery glow of the setting sun has dyed everything a
deep red.
<Page2>
The sun sets quickly in autumn.
The world will change in just a few minutes. Night is
right around the corner.
The sky above is already dark.
The boundary between red and black.
I exist within the nebulous moment in time that's
neither day nor night.
<Page3>
"―――Ah."
Looking up at the sky from the hallway, I notice
something.
The moon is already out.
Its face a perfect, peerless circle.
<Page4>
"......"
I forget myself for a moment, and simply gaze up at it.
<Page5>
A silver moon.
As beautiful as a glass bas-relief.
A pure, white visage. So vivid it feels like it could
spill from the sky at any moment.
<Page6>
I feel like―――
I saw a moon like this# back when I was a child,# at the
time I fell into a coma.
<Page7>
――――.
"...?!"
I feel a sudden pain from the scar on my chest.
<Page8>
――――.
My heart is beating like crazy.
I can feel my blood coursing through my body, and my
breathing is growing ragged.
<Page9>
――――  .
I place a hand on my chest.
It comes away sticky. My uniform is stained a deep red.
My scar is open and bleeding.
<Page10>
――――  .
"――― ―――――――"
I'm gasping for air.
The chills running down my spine are as cold as ice.
I'm shivering so intensely it's as though my spine is
trying to rip its way through my skin and escape. It's
agony.
<Page11>

――――――.
Mixed in with my heartbeat is another, sharper, sound.
<Page12>
"Ah――――――"
Someone is coming.
The figure emerging from the depths of the hallway
casts a long shadow across the floor.
Their footsteps echo coldly as they advance.
<Page13>
―――Something's wrong here.
I don't sense the same tempestuous fury that I felt
from Vlov.
The latent fear sending tremors through my entire body
isn't coming from outside, but from within.
<Page14>
A flash of pain shoots through my skull.
This pain, this sense of impending danger―――they
feel rooted within my own identity.
I―――Tohno Shiki, have a feeling that I absolutely
must not meet that person――――
<Page15>
"―――――――――"
I come to a halt.
It's already too late to run. It'll be over if I turn
around.
Still breathing heavily, I take off my glasses.
I unsheathe the knife hidden in my pocket.
<Page16>
The figure approaches.
A tall man.
The lines squirming around his body are surprisingly
sparse and hard to make out.
Yet at the same time, there is a 'point' at his core,
pulsating ominously.
It beats rhythmically, like a heart, as if proclaiming
his life in undeath.
<Page17>
"―――――――――――――――――――――"
I stop breathing.
My mind is a mess of unanswered questions.
I don't know this person.
I don't―――and yet, I can't help but feel like he
reminds me of someone.
. .
The man approaches.
Just a little closer, and I'll be able to get a good
look at his face.
<Page18>
"―――――――――――――――――――――"
Who does he remind me of?
Who does he remind me of?
Who does he remind me of?
Who is it that I've forgotten――――――
<Page19>
The man stops, as if to greet me.
He's still a ways away. I can't make out his face,
backlit as it is by the red light of the setting sun.
But I can see his eyes―――they glitter radiantly,
like those of a serpent eyeing its prey.
<Page20>
"The way I see it, a man's life is like a book without
a title."
A resonant voice.
Despite sounding so gentle, it sends a shiver down my
spine―――
I don't think I've ever heard something so viscerally
repulsive before. It makes me want to vomit.
<Page21>
"Books are small enough to grasp in one hand.
Their pages so brittle that they crumble with the
passage of time.
Soaked by water. Scorched by fire. Discarded by one's
own hand.
Records of the past are mere illusions, perpetually
being tampered with.
Nevertheless―――"
<Page22>
I ready my knife.
I stoop down, gauging the distance between us.
My instincts tell me I have no time to think, no room
for hesitation.
However, my sense of reason is too stubborn.
It prevents me from committing to the urge to kill him,
even if only for the span of a single breath.
<Page23>
"Even you amount to nothing more than a poorly written
text.
Life is such an enigma.
Wouldn't you agree? Tohno―――Shiki."
"―――...!"
<Page24>
I dash forward like a greyhound bolting out of the
gate.
Even knowing that it's already too late, I impatiently
propel myself forward as fast as I possibly can.
A display of physical ability I was unaware I was
capable of.
I close the ten meters between us in a single breath,
take aim at the man's lines, and sever―――
<Page25>
"――――――"
But as I feared, I was too late.
Even though I managed all that in a single breath―――
This guy manages to slip behind me in the mere blink of
an eye.
<Page26>
"――――――"
I can't react in time.
The man strikes my hand and snatches the knife away.
With eyes shining blue, he stares straight at the lines
on my body.
<Page27>
It's as if I alone am moving in slow motion.
The corners of his lips curl in amusement.
"I'm afraid you're out of luck.
The privilege of being able to see death is not yours
alone."
He aims my own knife back at me, and swings it down.
<Page28>
My spine locks up.
My brain freezes.
My body recalls the pain it felt when the same thing
was done to it before, long ago.
"―――――――――――Ah."
The sound of rending flesh.
The white steel pierces my chest as if slicing through
paper.
<Page29>
My body collapses.
All of the strength drains out of me, and I crumple to
the floor.
As I fall―――
I look up at the man's face.
<Page30>
"――――――"
I plunge into darkness.
His face. I don't recognize his face.
And yet, I remember. I remember this rush of blood.
<Page31>
That's because this guy―――
He's the exact same figure.
He's the same blood-soaked boy that lay before me on
that summer day long ago.
<Page32>
I hit the ground with a thud.
Strangely enough, there's no blood. I don't feel any
pain.
The knife remains lodged in my chest.
My body temperature is dropping. My consciousness is
fading. I'm slowly losing the ability to even move my
body at all.
<Page33>
"With this, you have repaid him in kind for having
killed you. Surely you have no other regrets.
Time to put your book on the pyre, Tohno―――SHIKI."
<Page34>
The man is addressing empty space.
Ah―――why did I forget about it until now?
Back when I was a child.
When I played in the gardens of the Tohno mansion, it
was always myself, Akiha... and one other child.
<Page35>
We were―――we were inseparable.
Even when I played with Akiha, I was inviting her to
join in with the  of us. So then, why――――
Why had I forgotten his name up until now?
<Page36>
"SHI――――KI."
"That's right, Shiki. It really has been a while.
Although―――it seems you were a little too late.
The owner of this body, Tohno SHIKI, is no longer with
us.# After all, his revenge against you is now
complete."
<Page37>
The man speaks. Though our names may sound the same,
their spellings differ.
Tohno SHIKI.
SHIKI. Shiki. Akiha. SHIKI. SHIKI. Akiha. Shiki.
I remember the words scratched into the gazebo.
<Page38>
"Yo...u...'re―――"
"That's right. I'm the one you're looking for.
The vampire that resurrected into this body. Adversary
of the Princess.
That, too, is a moniker reserved only for tonight."
<Page39>
An unpleasant laugh, and the same unsettling feeling I
experienced looking at Vlov.
As my consciousness fades, I finally make the
connection.
This guy―――is Arcueid's 'enemy'.
