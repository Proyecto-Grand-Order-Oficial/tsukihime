The lesson is over.
As the hubbub in the classroom builds, I alone remain
at my desk, as though still listening to the lecture.
<Page2>
"Tohno, could you come here for a moment?"
The physics teacher calls out to me from the podium.
"Yes, what is it?"
I reply and head to the podium.
<Page3>
"I just want to confirm something. I've heard some
reports recently that you've been spotted around the
downtown area late at night. Does this ring any bells?"
"Yes. I had some business to take care of in the city
these past few days."
"Oh dear. So it is true."
<Page4>
The physics teacher frowns, but his expression then
softens somewhat.
"I know you're not the type of student to go and mess
around late at night, but it's been raised as an issue
at our staff meetings. It seems that someone from the
student guidance department would like to have a word
with you about it.
That is to say, please head to the tea ceremony room
after school."
With a brief farewell, the teacher exits the classroom.
<Page5>
It's now the end of the school day.
I drop by the tea ceremony room, but the guidance
counselor has yet to arrive.
<Page6>
Our school doesn't have a dedicated student counseling
room.
Counseling sessions usually take place in empty
classrooms or the staff room, but sometimes they'll
happen in a disused clubroom, as is the case today.
...It seems like the tea ceremony club was abolished
quite some time ago. It's certainly true that it's not
a club that's currently in vogue.
<Page7>
"―――――"
I sit down on the tatami and wait for the guidance
counselor to arrive.
"...."
I bite my lip in frustration.
I'm fully aware that I don't have time to be doing
this.
Even so, there's nothing else I can do.
<Page8>
With club activities on hold and the end of the school
day pushed forward, the school building is becoming
quieter by the minute.
...I'm about to go mad.
Why am I here? Why am I doing this?
<Page9>
I can't help but get angry at my own helplessness.
But since there's no way to fix it, in the end, I have
no choice but to do as I'm told, like the husk that I
am.
<Page10>
"...What the hell am I doing?"
There's no answer.
Suppressing my irritation, I continue to wait in the
deserted clubroom for night to fall.
<Page11>
.
The second hand of the clock ticks, informing me that
it's just turned six o'clock.
In the end, no one came to the tea ceremony room.
The school closes its gates at four and the teachers
leave at five, so at this point there's nobody else
left in the school.
<Page12>
"...I wonder if I've been forgotten."
In a way, I feel like this worked out well for me.
It gave me a reason not to return to the mansion.
It's not that I don't want to go back there, I simply
can't just yet.
<Page13>
I unfold my legs and stand up.
...This tea ceremony room isn't bad.
 My mind feels a
bit clearer now that I've had the chance to reflect on
things by myself like this.
<Page14>
I've had plenty of time to think.
About what I should do, and about what's important to
me.
Right now, I should―――
C:> Search for Arcueid, even if it's futile.
C:> Return to the mansion.
C:> Look for Roa by myself.
