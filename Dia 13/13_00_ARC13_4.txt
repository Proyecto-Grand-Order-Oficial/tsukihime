<Page1>
"...What the hell happened here?"
The inside of the school is pockmarked and cratered.
It's like a small typhoon swept through the halls,
starting at the bottom and working its way up.
<Page2>
"...!"
Ciel may have sped through the city at a breakneck
pace, but it still wasn't enough to catch up with
Arcueid.
Her battle with Roa has already begun...!
<Page3>
"They're upstairs...!"
<Page4>
I run down the hallway.
The erratic sounds of destruction echo in the distance,
and I can smell burning in the air.
My consciousness attempts to retreat with every step
that I take. I clench my fists as I fight to keep a
hold of myself.
My fingernails dig into the palms of my hands and I use
that pain to spur my body onward.
<Page5>
I'll happily destroy my left hand with my own nails if
it means I can keep my body moving.
I only need one working hand to carry my knife.
<Page6>
I reach the end of the hallway and rush up the stairs.
The sounds are getting louder. They're probably coming
from the third floor.
I've almost caught up.
If I make it in time, we still have a chance. Arcueid
knows about my eyes, and she's a calm and rational
thinker on the battlefield. Once she knows I'm here,
she'll let me make full use of my abilities. She'll
defend and I'll attack: same way we played it against
Vlov. So long as she's able to pin Roa down, I'll take
care of the rest. No matter what happens, no matter the
risks, I'll break through.
<Page7>
That's why―――I can't stop here...!
<Page8>
"―――――――――――!"
I reach the third floor.
The trail of destruction carved across the walls
continues on down the corridor―――
All the way down to the walkway that connects the two
school buildings together.
<Page9>
"―――――shit!"
Forcing my faltering legs to move, I sprint down the
corridor.
<Page10>
I reach the end of the corridor, where it angles off to
join the walkway.
―――What I find there is a battle in its final
moments.
<Page11>
Within that walkway―――
Two figures, confronting each other at a cautious
distance.
<Page12>
On the far side of the walkway stands Roa, loitering
with an air of relaxed assurance.
<Page13>
In the center of the walkway is Arcueid, slumped to her
knees, her breathing heavy and erratic.
<Page14>
"――――――"
―――But, who is this person?
This isn't the Arcueid I know at all. Far from it.
<Page15>
Thick black lines snake across her entire body.
She seems utterly drained, and her body is on the verge
of collapse. It's like she already has one foot in the
grave.
She is now only a shadow of the beautiful flower I saw
in the penthouse hotel room that night―――
<Page16>
"Arcueid――――!"
I rush in. I don't give a shit about Roa anymore.
I don't care what kind of traps might await me in this
walkway.
I just sprint toward Arcueid as fast as I'm physically
able.
<Page17>
But before I get very far―――
She locks eyes with me.
Still on her knees, Arcueid turns back and fixes me
with her glare.
<Page18>
"......?!"
My body... won't move...?!
The instant I met her gaze, my entire body was frozen
solid, as though it had been turned to stone.
<Page19>
"Hm... what a cold woman. To think you'd turn your
Mystic Eyes on a companion running so desperately to
your aid.
You could at least have given him the honor of dying
loyally by your side."
<Page20>
An amused voice reverberates down the walkway.
His grin isn't directed at me, but at the kneeling
figure of Arcueid.
<Page21>
"Mystic Eyes―――but why?"
Why is Arcueid using something like that against me?
Even though...
Even though I finally made it here――――!
<Page22>
"―――Let go.
Let me go, Arcueid...!"
<Page23>
Arcueid averts her gaze from me and turns to face Roa.
She says... nothing.
She doesn't explain herself to me at all.
All she does is stare at the enemy standing before her,
a look of pain on her face.
<Page24>
"Why――――why――――"
I lose the ability to even speak.
This isn't one of the effects of Arcueid's Mystic Eyes.
I made it all the way here, and yet...! I'm frustrated
with myself for being so powerless, and my body, which
had protested at every step of my journey here, begins
to grow cold.
<Page25>
"Good, so you've finally made up your mind, Princess!
I have to say you've made the right call. Especially
considering that your back's up against the wall. After
all, if you don't kill me now, there will be 
pitiful corpses by the time this is all over.
If you don't want that―――then show me that last bit
of pride of yours."
"Ro――――a...!"
<Page26>
Roa takes one step toward Arcueid, then another.
Each time he advances, a part of his body contorts and
is wrenched off―――his shoulder, his stomach, his
limbs.
<Page27>
But the effects only last a moment.
His body immediately restores itself, and he shows no
signs of slowing down.
<Page28>
"But this really is something, boy.
It seems like the princess has decided to cross swords
with me to save your life. However―――"
<Page29>
"You would have been terrifying had you been the
princess you once were, but now you're nothing more
than an ordinary vampire. You cannot truly make use of
your power as a True Ancestor.
...How sad. So sad that it breaks my heart. But also...
how unbecoming. It would have been far better for you
to simply give in to your desires if the alternative
was to sink to such a wretched state."
<Page30>
"―――Shut up...!"
Arcueid's voice rings out across the walkway.
<Page31>
"The ability to temporarily rewrite physical phenomena.
The power to manipulate natural phenomena as you see
fit, to exercise control over enthalpy. Such are the
natural rights of True Ancestors as the planet's sense
of touch itself.
Truly, the   . No matter how much
humans strive to master magecraft, we will never manage
to measure up to the True Ancestors."
<Page32>
"However―――at the same time, you cannot interfere
with us humans directly.
That's because the apes we humans once were have
evolved to become possessed of prosperity, knowledge,
independence, and wisdom. We are no longer in the same
category as this planet."
<Page33>
"The best you seem to be able to muster now is to slice
at me with that vacuum of yours.
But that's no longer enough to stop me. And besides,
I've already surpassed you. You see, there is something
I have that you don't."
<Page34>
"――――――"
Arcueid has stopped breathing altogether.
The air she's giving off feels incredibly dangerous,
it's as though she's abandoned her own self to better
focus on gathering her strength.
<Page35>
"You understand, don't you? That's right. It's the
experience of death.
While I understand  feeling, you do not.
That is the crucial difference that separates the two
of us. It is impossible for a living creature to have
experienced death. That knowledge is reserved
exclusively for me, the Reincarnator."
<Page36>
"Don't―――do, it."
The space around Arcueid begins to warp and distort
more and more violently.
I have to stop her...
I have to stop her right now, even if it means grabbing
her, spinning her around, and slapping her across the
face.
Because if I don't, then everything―――
<Page37>
"All creatures harbor an instinctive fear of the
unknown. Not even otherworldly beings such as the True
Ancestors are free of it.
And yet, no matter how much you study the arcane, no
matter how long your lifespan may be, you will never be
able to experience that return to nothingness―――true
death."
<Page38>
"By rejecting death, you have obtained incredible
power, but at the same time, you have hamstrung
yourselves.
While you have avoided death, I have accepted it.
 is what sets Michael Roa Valdamjong apart from
Arcueid Brunestud.
Even now, I live in the age of man as a human. A
specter of a bygone era such as yourself has no right
to punish me."
<Page39>
I hear a cracking sound.
The windows lining the walkway are overlain by images
of something else entirely.
"Stop, it―――"
Can Roa not see this?
This billowing wave of energy so potent that death
itself cannot trespass upon it.
<Page40>
"But, if you still wish to challenge me, I won't stop
you.
You can experience firsthand the retribution for these
past thousand years.
After that―――ah, yes.
I suppose I'd better fulfill this body's purpose,
slowly, so as to savor every minute of it."
<Page41>
The corners of his mouth twist upwards, his smile the
sharp sliver of a crescent moon.
Roa has finally turned to rest his gaze on me.
He said that he would savor killing me. That he'd
follow through on the vendetta carried by his
body―――by SHIKI.
<Page42>
"       "
"―――?!"
<Page43>
Arcueid's surroundings transform.
It's as though her desires have altered the blueprint
carved into the memory of the planet itself,
rearranging its constituent atoms, its atmosphere.
<Page44>
"―――You're right. I have deteriorated."
'But that's okay', she declares silently.
She takes a steadying breath, as though confirming once
again in her heart that she doesn't regret it one bit.
"―――Begone. I will not let you kill  Shiki."
<Page45>
The world is turned upside down―――
Replaced by an unfamiliar landscape.
Even from my position outside the universe she's
created, I can feel an invisible pressure bearing down
on me.
I can't even begin to imagine the 'fear' that Roa must
feel, trapped as he is within that space.
<Page46>
"It's gone―――there are no Magecraft Foundations
here―――or ...?!
Hold on, magecraft can't be enacted under these
conditions! It's not just that the magical energy here
is depleted, the very order itself is incomplete! It's
almost as if―――!"
<Page47>
Arcueid solemnly raises her hand.
"Ah―――――――"
My voice won't come out.
This is bad. This is really bad. At this rate, she'll
kill Roa.
<Page48>
But if she does, she'll also die.
These last vestiges of her, barely clinging on as it
is, will be lost without a trace.
Even tormented by this knowledge, I still can't manage
to call out to her.
<Page49>
"I see―――so this is that which forms the celestial!
My Pantheon, the   that brought me to
corruption...!
Ooh, Blessings upon thee! Blessings upon thee!
Blessings upon thee!
I had it right―――my theory was correct all along!"
<Page50>
Even under the crushing weight of despair, the vampire
howls ecstatically.
With a look of pure contempt―――
She eradicates the man as though swatting an insect.
<Page51>
When I open my eyes, Roa's body is nowhere to be seen.
It was disfigured, torn to shreds, and then flattened.
The walkway is back to how it looked before.
<Page52>
It seems that the vision I saw was only temporary.
The walkway itself hasn't changed.
The only difference is that now, all that's left of Roa
are his ankles.
<Page53>
―――However.
The battle is not so easily won.
<Page54>

The ankles move.
With a splashing sound, they begin to walk on their own
across the sea of blood.
<Page55>
As they move―――
With each step they take, they begin to regain their
shape. The ankles sprout thighs, the thighs knit
together to form hips, and from there a torso, then two
arms...

My voice doesn't reach her.
Still on her knees, Arcueid no longer even bothers to
lift her head.

<Page59>
"―――Well, that was close. I was right to choose
tonight of all nights. If it hadn't been a full moon,
reviving from nothing more than my ankles would've been
impossible."
<Page60>
"And as for you, Princess. You will not be able to
revive from the wound I'm about to inflict.
My claws, you see, have the same ability as that boy
over there."
<Page61>
My body won't move.
"Ar――――――"
Not even my voice will reach her in time.
<Page62>
Having fully revived to his original state, Roa slices
Arcueid across the stomach.
He does it effortlessly, as though simply severing a
line. There is no rending of flesh. There is no
spilling of blood.
<Page63>
.
Arcueid crumples to the floor.
<Page64>
"―――This is the power that comes from experiencing
death.
It's ironic, but I didn't work out how to wield this
power by myself.
 the one who gave me a taste of how to use it. Of
course, it was no big deal once I got the hang of it.
As someone who has seen death countless times, it isn't
all that hard to read the death of things."
<Page65>
Speaking in a triumphant voice, Roa kicks Arcueid's
body away.
He sends her flying in my direction.
<Page66>
"Arcueid...!"
My body moves.
Arcueid's Mystic Eyes must have lost their hold over
me.
...Which would mean that her powers have failed her.
Shaking off that line of thought, I take her body in my
arms―――
<Page67>
―――As soon as I pick her up, a shiver runs down my
spine.
Arcueid's body is frighteningly cold.
The heat she still manages to give off is barely that
of a candle's flame.
<Page68>
...I put on my glasses out of an instinctive fear.
Roa is still right there in front of me.
But I couldn't care less about him.
Right now―――all I want to do is save Arcueid.
<Page69>
"Arcueid――――!"
I call her name.
Her closed eyelids slowly flutter open, as though she
were waking from a deep sleep.
<Page70>
"Aha―――that wasn't very cool, was it?"
Her cheery attitude is beginning to fray around the
edges.
Even so, Arcueid smiles enchantingly.
<Page71>
"You... what are you talking about, you idiot?
Why―――why did you―――"
<Page72>
...My voice catches in my throat.
I want to say something more, something better, but my
mind is an absolute mess.
<Page73>
I mean, just how am I supposed to remain calm.
The body heat I feel as I cradle her in my arms is
already desperately faint.
If I hadn't put on my glasses―――I'm sure I'd be
seeing something that would give me even more cause for
despair.
That―――
That is something that I never wish to see.
<Page74>
"Why―――why, why―――"
Those useless words are all that I can manage.
Growing more and more frustrated with myself―――
I embrace Arcueid harder than ever before.
<Page75>
...But she doesn't embrace me in return.
There's no strength left in Arcueid's body.
All that she can do is put on a happy-looking smile.
<Page76>
"You're kidding―――――"
Right. This must be a joke.
<Page77>
"―――Why―――why did you―――why did you do all of
this on your own...?!
We're partners, aren't we? I said I'd cooperate with
you―――that I'd help you right up until the end...!"
<Page78>
"...You're right... you did say something like that.
I guess... I must have forgotten."
<Page79>
"You can't go forgetting something like that...!
Doesn't this―――doesn't this make me the lowest of
the low?
I told you that I would help you. I promised that I
would―――but in the end I couldn't do anything."
<Page80>
"...No, that's not true, Shiki.
You helped me plenty of times.
...That's why you... you've done enough."
.
She smiles painfully through blood-flecked lips.
<Page81>
"...That's why, I thought I should do at least this
much to show my gratitude.
...Yeah. I think... I may have pushed myself a bit too
far.
I'm glad... I was able to protect you from Roa... in
the end."
"―――――――"
<Page82>
I'm speechless.
...Arcueid's eyes no longer see anything.
She hasn't noticed her own wounds, nor has she realized
that Roa's still alive.
For her―――
Time had already come to an end the instant she
delivered that blow against Roa.
<Page83>
"――――――"
That's enough. Please stop.
I can't speak. My throat refuses to form words.
But, even so, I need to uphold her dream.
<Page84>
"T―――T-T... Thank you. You saved... me."
I feel like I'll go insane.
I couldn't even lie to her convincingly.
<Page85>
...The color begins to fade from her eyes.
Her body heat is steadily ebbing away.
―――I'm going to lose her.
Am I really going to let her slip away like this?
<Page86>
"...Ar...cueid."
"―――What?"
"...Drink my blood.
Your strength will return if you do, won't it...?!"
...I shout out those words without thinking.
<Page87>
"......"
Arcueid doesn't say anything.
Instead, she responds so feebly that it's almost
imperceptible―――
By shaking her head.
<Page88>
"―――Why?!
What are you still afraid of?! Listen to me. Do you
remember what you said a couple days ago? You asked me
if I'd still eat birds or fish even if they had the
same level of intelligence as me.
I'd still eat them! I'd eat them because I have to if I
want to keep on living.
Isn't that the natural order of things? To take the
lives of others in order to survive...?"
<Page89>
These are the words that she herself had said.
But despite that―――
She shakes her head, a look of sorrow in her eyes.
<Page90>
"I... don't like... talking about... what-ifs."
Words of rejection.
Those were―――#the words that I had always said.
She'd told me this herself.
That she liked what-ifs and hypotheticals. That they
made her feel like there was some kind of salvation out
there.
<Page91>
"Is―――is that right? But... but I like them.
Even... even if they're nothing more than sophistry.
D-Don't they make you feel like―――there's―――"
<Page92>
'salvation out there somewhere'... Is what I wanted to
say.
But there's a lump in my throat.
Because of it, I wasn't able to get those words out
clearly.
<Page93>
"...I guess so... but... right now... there's something
I want more than that."
"Something... you want?
Sure. I'll do anything for you―――so tell me."
"...Yeah. I want you... to kiss me."
―――Is that it?
Is your one wish really for something so simple?
<Page94>
I press my lips to hers.
There is none of the sweetness, none of the tenderness
that was present the other day.
It was simply me touching her cold lips with my own. A
kiss without warmth.
Nothing more.
<Page95>
After I draw away―――
She smiles from the bottom of her heart.
<Page96>
"...I'm glad. I've always wanted to do something like
that."
"...I see. You have some strange aspirations, don't
you?"
<Page97>
"...Yeah, I feel strangely happy. It was something so
small, but it meant so much to me. I've been alive for
an incredibly long time, but in all those years I've
never experienced anything close to the joy I feel
right now."
――――That's why...
"I felt like I wouldn't mind going out on a high like
this."
She murmurs those words.
As she finishes speaking, her body goes cold.
<Page98>
"Ar... cueid...?"

...I wanted to make her happy.
I wanted to teach her all sorts of new things.

I wanted... to be with her forever.

her own, and I wasn't even able to say anything

"Yeah, I'm done here."
I raise my head, and face her enemy.
