We race through the darkened city and finally arrive at
the school.
Senpai ran the whole way here, leaping from rooftop to
rooftop, just as Arcueid had, but somehow she isn't
even short of breath despite also having to carry me
the entire time.
<Page2>
...It's only now beginning to dawn on me that she may
actually be just as outrageous a person as Arcueid
herself.
<Page3>
"Tohno-kun, can you walk?"
"I'll walk even if I can't.
I have to, if we're going to kill Roa."
<Page4>
"...I guess you're right. Then please stand on your own
two feet from here on."
Senpai sets me down on the ground.
<Page5>
"―――――"
The school building is eerily quiet.
The only thing that awaits us once we enter is a fight
to the death.
I draw a deep breath, and take off my glasses.
<Page6>
I'm struck by a splitting headache.
This intense discomfort, coupled with the fact that I
can't even move my body properly, is almost enough to
make me want to scream.
<Page7>
"...This is bad. He may have only just awakened, but if
he's being bolstered by the current phase of the
moon..."
<Page8>
Senpai gazes up at the night sky with a serious look on
her face.
The lambent light of the moon spills down, illuminating
the darkened school.
<Page9>
"...What's so bad, exactly?"
"I'm talking about Roa's condition. The extent of a
True Ancestor's power waxes and wanes in accordance
with the phase of the moon. The fuller the moon gets,
the stronger they become. The same is true even for
Dead Apostles like him.
...Tonight, he borders on being almost unkillable. It's
possible that I may not be able to kill him with the
equipment I have on hand."
<Page10>
―――So he's practically unkillable.
Still, that means nothing to me.
So long as there exists a way for him to 'die', then it
doesn't matter how difficult he might be to kill. I can
kill him all the same.
<Page11>
I just need him to get close. It doesn't matter if he
pierces my chest the instant after he does―――if he
gets close, I'll skewer his 'death' in less time than
it takes to draw a single breath.
<Page12>
"But still, it really is bright out tonight. We'll have
a hard time sneaking in under the cover of darkness.
#...#I normally love nights when the moon is shining
bright like this, but I suppose today is something of
an exception."
Senpai breathes out a sigh.
<Page13>
...The night is blue, frozen in place beneath the
brilliant light of the moon.
Beautiful as it may appear, it puts the death of
existence on full display.
"Is that so? Personally I hate bright, moonlit nights."
"Tohno-kun...?"
.
My brain creaks.
<Page14>
"...Because unlike the sun, the soft light of the moon
reveals things I'd rather not see. Sunlight strong
enough to overpower the lines, or even complete
darkness would be more comfortable."
<Page15>
.
It isn't pain that's causing my brain to grate like
this, but the knowledge of what's coming next.
<Page16>
"Ah―――the world looks even more messed up than usual
tonight.
Everything seems like it's on the verge of death. It's
as though I've been transported to the barren surface
of the moon."
―――Although, with things the way they are...
The chances of me being unable to see Roa's 'death' are
vanishingly slim.
<Page17>
"Tohno-kun, this is where we part ways.
From here on, you're on your own. I'll be taking a
different approach."
"A different approach... Senpai, are you planning on
doing something?"
<Page18>
"Come on now. You do understand that I'm also here to
deal with Roa, right? It's just that this incarnation
seems to be more powerful than usual, so I'm not about
to rush in and face him head-on.
Once he's finished killing you and Arcueid, I'll use
that opportunity to rain judgment down upon him."
<Page19>
Senpai remains completely deadpan as she informs me of
her battle plan.
...Yeah. I'm glad I can count on her not to try and
gloss over the hard truths.
<Page20>
"I understand. I know it's selfish of me, but I'll be
relying on you to clean up if it comes down to that."
<Page21>
"Right. This is as far as I'll allow personal matters
to interfere with my work.
You're fighting for her sake, aren't you? In the same
way, I'm also fighting for my own reasons.
That's why―――I cannot help the two of you any more
than I already have."
<Page22>
"I understand. Thank you, Senpai.
...I'll go ahead and say this now, since this might be
the last time we see each other. I really liked you.
Hanging out and shooting the breeze with you and
Arihiko was really fun."
<Page23>
"―――Yeah. It was like a dream for me too."
<Page24>
Senpai flits away toward the school building, vanishing
like a bird melting into the darkness.
<Page25>
"Alright―――here goes nothing."
I ready myself as well.
I slip past the front gate.
I can barely even walk properly.
The school building feels impossibly distant.
With every step I take, a fresh wave of nausea washes
over me, but still I push through and force my body to
jog toward the school.
