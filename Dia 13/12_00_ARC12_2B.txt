"Now then―――I think I'll take that knife back.
You won't be needing it where you're headed."
<Page2>
Roa reaches out for the knife stuck in my chest.
He grasps it by the handle.
It's clear that I'll die the instant he pulls it out.
There's nothing I can do.
My body won't move at all. I can't even blink.
<Page3>
"―――――――"
He's gone.
Suddenly, Roa vanishes from my field of view.
In the same instant, a figure dressed in nun's clothing
enters it.
The one who smashed the third-floor window and came
tumbling inside is―――
<Page4>
"――――――"
"――――――"
<Page5>
"Numeromancy-based lightning... I see.
It appears that you've completely taken over, Roa."
"...Sen...pai?"
<Page6>
Senpai... that's right. This person is Ciel-senpai.
I thought she'd already left, but here she is facing
off against that vampire to protect me―――
<Page7>
"........."
Their abilities seem to be on par with each other.
However, there's a caveat―――the sun hasn't
completely set yet.
――――And then...
Roa suddenly bursts out laughing, as if he's just
realized something.
<Page8>
"―――  !"
<Page9>
"I see, so that's how it is, woman! I hadn't even
considered that a case like this might exist!
Incredible, I'd expect nothing less. I've been
reincarnating over and over again for 800 years. There
was bound to be one or two exceptions, and now that
time has finally come!"
<Page10>
Roa continues to cackle gleefully.
...Senpai simply glares back at the vampire in silence.
<Page11>
"What's wrong? You came here to kill me, did you not?
Or what? Is an empty shell like you really that
powerless?"
"――――――"
<Page12>
Senpai doesn't respond.
Instead, she turns away from the vampire and takes my
fallen body in her arms.
<Page13>
"Oh? Are you really prioritizing that impostor over
severing the karmic ties that bind the two of us
together?
It's useless, I'm afraid. He can no longer be saved."
<Page14>
"After all, I just gave Tohno Shiki what he deserved
for having lived as he pleased all this time.
There is no cure for one whose line of death has been
cut.
That princess may have revived, but she had to give up
800 years of her life in exchange. A mere human has no
such means to escape from 'death'."
<Page15>
His sneering voice is the only thing I can make out.
Senpai bites her lip, holding back the rage she feels
toward that vampire.
She stifles her urge to jump up and slay him right this
instant.
All of that...
in order to protect me, cradled here in her arms.
<Page16>
"Yeah, we get it. Good job on the reincarnation.
Been fuckin' waitin' for this. We finally meet,
Valdamjong."
I hear a child's voice emanating from Senpai's chest.
Is that... Mario's voice coming out of a speaker...?
<Page17>
"Who might you be? You seem to be acting awfully
friendly with me."
"I'm the Acting Presbyter sent to this city.
Name's Mario Gallo Bestino.
Surely you know what that entails, you snake fuck."
<Page18>
"Bestino... you're an illegitimate child of Laurentis,
aren't you?
I see―――I'm shocked to hear he's still alive.
It appears things have taken a somewhat amusing turn
over there."
<Page19>
"Yeah, thanks to you. The ol' man's losin' his mind
even as we speak.
So, how's it goin'? You completely Valdamjong now?
Reincarnation complete, right? If not, then please, no
need to hold back: I can only hold off the Church for
'bout seven days, so hurry up and wake up, will ya?"
"Choose your words carefully, Acting Presbyter... That
could be considered treason against the Church."
<Page20>
"Fuck off. Don't wanna hear that shit from you, Ciel.
Also, don't worry―――we're definitely gonna kill this
fuckin' Dead Apostle. But before that, there's a
precious little somethin' I gotta get from him. Surely
even Ms. Goody Two-Shoes will understand if I say it's
an order from the ol' man?
Alright, so how's it gonna be, Serpent of Akasha? You
remember this time around? Where's the  
?"
<Page21>
"Have you grown so old that you're in need of
immortality, Laurentis?
Still, I'm certain I noted it down quite
specifically―――
Perfect immortality is impossible to achieve while one
remains human.
If the thieves who rummaged through my library failed
to heed that advice, then they simply got their just
deserts."
<Page22>
"Don't act so fuckin' full of yourself. All that means
is thatcha left it unfinished, right?
Or what? You gonna tell me the kinda immortality the
ol' man's out for don't exist?"
<Page23>
"Unfortunately, I am. My research changed to focus
primarily on the soul.
My dalliance with the body was little more than a
passing fancy. Nothing came of it but theory that could
never be realized in practice.
Magecraft isn't the right word for such a dubious
rite―――'curse' is the better descriptor, Bestino."
"You're sayin'...?"
<Page24>
"I'm saying it was a waste of time. The puzzle of 'how
not to age' cannot be solved. Go on and suffer until
your death, it will prove invigorating."
<Page25>
The silence that follows is frightening...
Even through his microphone, I can sense Mario's
disappointment. His despair. His hatred. His anger.
<Page26>
"You called it a curse, didn't you, Valdamjong?"
"I did. These are all   that I have
developed.
Even if the Holy Church is unfamiliar with magecraft,
surely the Acting Presbyter at least understands how
they work."
<Page27>
"Pull back, Ciel... We'll take him down later. We'll
crush this snake fuck once we got more people."
<Page28>
Still carrying me in her arms, Ciel-senpai leaps up
onto the sill of the shattered window.
...The man simply watches us go, a wry smile on his
face.
<Page29>
"―――Feel free to leave, I don't care. I've something
much more important to attend to.
Now that I've revealed myself as Roa, that princess
will visit me soon enough.
I had better prepare a warm welcome for her."
<Page30>
Senpai turns her back on the vampire and jumps out the
third-floor window.
<Page31>
It seems that she doesn't think anything of a
three-story fall.
After alighting on the ground with a soft thud, Senpai
retreats from the school without looking back.
<Page32>
As all this happens―――
I gaze back at the man, my eyes glazing over.
...He had the same name as the child in my memories.
Tohno SHIKI, a human who had still been alive all this
time, has now been overwritten by the vampire known as
Roa.
<Page33>
Still carrying me in her arms, Senpai makes a beeline
for the Tohno mansion.
...I'm not sure what she's planning on doing here, but
I can't see it going well.
The knife is still lodged in my chest, and I'm
definitely dying. If Akiha sees me like this, 'worried'
won't even begin to describe it.
<Page34>
"――――――"
...Shit. My voice won't come out.
I want to tell her to stop, but it's taking all I have
just to keep on breathing.
<Page35>
"I need you to stay quiet, Tohno-kun!
...It's okay. If anyone can save you, it's your
sister...!"
<Page36>
"――――――"
...Save me? That's impossible, Senpai.
I've been stabbed in the heart with a knife, and I've
already lost all control over my body.
...There's nobody in the world who can save a person
that's this close to death's door.
<Page37>
"No, she can. Otherwise, it wouldn't make any sense...!
Listen up. If she didn't have the power to save you,
then you would have died seven years ago.
That's why... there's still a chance this time
around...!"
<Page38>
...Senpai, what do you mean by...
"Geez, just settle down and be quiet already!
You definitely won't make it if you don't shut up!"
<Page39>
Her expression is stern. I've never seen anyone so
angry before.
...I feel like I've done something very wrong, so I
close my eyes.
......Well, whatever.
.........Besides,
it was getting rather hard    to stay awake   
anyway―――
