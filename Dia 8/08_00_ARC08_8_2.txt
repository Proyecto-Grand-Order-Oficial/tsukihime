I'll confront her as an enemy.
Without switching to a more guarded stance, I'll take
her on.
<Page2>
After all, falling back wouldn't exactly help me out
here―――The reach on that weapon of hers is in a
class of its own.
The moment I go on the defensive, Noel will happily
swing away at me with her spear.
<Page3>
"Hmm? Aren't you going to run away, or at least defend
yourself?
Oh I see, you're so afraid that you're frozen solid ♥
Mmmhmm, that's just the right way for a young man in
the   to behave!
Even though you do those  with that vampire every
night, how cute ☆"
<Page4>
Two steps. Three steps. Four steps.#
―――One more step to go.
My weapon is about as short as they come, and doesn't
pack much of a punch either.
I can't afford to mess up here.
She, on the other hand, is relaxed enough to
speak―――
<Page5>
"As I thought―――you must have only gone after people
that didn't resist so far, huh?!"
Just like that.
It's easy to imagine that her attack would obliterate
my entire right flank, arm and all.
<Page6>
The mass of iron just barely clears the top of my head.
"Huh? You fell down―――?!"
I throw myself to the floor, evading her spear as it
carves a swathe through the air eighty centimeters
above the ground.
<Page7>
Before I hit the ground, I kick myself back upright and
keep going until I'm right up in her face.
<Page8>
"N-No way―――"
I wrap my left hand around her waist. I press close to
her, like a ballroom dancer.
My right hand, clutching the knife, coils around the
back of her neck.
<Page9>
With this, I can kill her in a single breath.
<Page10>
But, before I do...
I idly start to wonder if I should first consider just
whose enemy this woman really is?
<Page11>
"You little... don't underestimate me!"
The woman lets go of her spear, then simultaneously
grabs hold of my right hand from around her neck and
sweeps my leg out from under me.
In Judo, you'd call it an .
<Page12>
" ...!"
I slam into the ground, back first.
It's completely different from my previous fall.
I'm still just hitting the ground, but being  to
it with such a precise application of physical strength
can easily be enough to destroy the body.
<Page13>
"That was close... but that knee trip was pretty nice
just now!
I was only copying her, but man did I nail it!"
<Page14>
Noel picks up her spear while she continues to hype
herself up.
I'm still lying on my back where I fell. She awkwardly
clears her throat, and then stomps on my chest with her
boot.
<Page15>
"..."
"W-Well, that wasn't bad for a fluke.
Though, the bit where you acted like you were going to
run away and fell over didn't look as cool."
<Page16>
With a triumphant smile, Noel digs her boot in a little
deeper.
There still isn't that much force behind it, but it
seems her hostility and desire to kill are no joke.
<Page17>
"Don't tell me... You're a vampire too?"
I ask just to be sure.
<Page18>
"I trampled you not five seconds ago and yet here you
are calmly asking questions.
And not even a very serious question at that.
What, a brat like you is trying to ask  a leading
question? That's the sort of audacity I despise as a
teacher!"
<Page19>
"...!"
She exaggeratedly stomps on me again, but since her
motions are so showy, she doesn't actually hit my chest
all that hard.
<Page20>
But that reaction... As I suspected, this woman is
human. She's disgusted by the mere suggestion that
she's a vampire.
Anyway, that's great and all, but it sure would be nice
if she'd go back to acting like a teacher.
