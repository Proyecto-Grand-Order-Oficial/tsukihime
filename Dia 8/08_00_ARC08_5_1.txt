...I'll tell her the truth.
Hisui and Kohaku-san are in charge of managing the
mansion. There's no way I'd be able to slip a lie past
them, no matter how well-crafted.
Given that, I should at least be upfront about the fact
that I will be away from home tonight.
<Page2>
"...Yeah. I'll actually be heading out every night for
a while, I'm not sure exactly how long.
But I swear I'm not messing around or doing anything
inappropriate. I know that Akiha will hate me for this,
but I can't just stop what I'm doing halfway."
<Page3>
...That's right.
There's a mysterious vampire on the loose, claiming the
lives of who knows how many victims, and the only one
who can stop them is Arcueid.
As a human being who lives in this city, I cannot look
away and pretend that everything is okay.
<Page4>
"I know I'm asking a lot, but if you can overlook this
for a little while, I'd really appreciate it. I'll be
back around midnight, so can I ask you to leave just
the front door unlocked?"
<Page5>
"Do you mean to say that you are unable to give us a
reason why?"
"...Yeah. Sorry, Hisui. I'd like for you to just write
me off as worthless, and not ask any more questions."
<Page6>
"...No. You are my master.
No servant would scorn their own master and call them
worthless."
<Page7>
Hisui answers matter-of-factly, her expression blank.
With that, the conversation comes to an end.
I bow my head to her and start to climb the lobby
stairs.
<Page8>
"Please wait a moment.#"
And then...
From behind, Hisui calls me to stop, her voice calmer
than I've ever heard it before.
<Page9>
"...Well, I know this may be impertinent of me to ask,
but..."
Hisui trails off, but then clenches her hands tightly
and turns to stare right at me.
<Page10>
"If you would like me to, I can hide the fact that you
are going out at night from Akiha-sama."
"As in... we should use this time to get our stories
straight... Is that what you're saying?"
<Page11>
"Yes. It is rare for Akiha-sama to leave her room after
dinner. Nee-san and I are the ones responsible for
performing the evening inspection, so if we were to
neglect to mention anything out of the ordinary in our
report, then there would be no way for anyone to know
that you were not in your room."
<Page12>
"Well, that would be a big help. But... are you okay
with doing that?
Aren't you two employed by Akiha?"
"I believe I stated before that my master is you."
<Page13>
...I still don't really know what to think of that
myself.
Back in the beginning I was asking her to stop
attaching '-sama' to my name, and now here I am
feverishly thanking her.
Hisui, in her own way, listened to my shoddy excuses
and then said that she would help me.
<Page14>
"Thank you, Hisui. It would help me out a lot if you
did that."
"In that case, please use this keycard from tonight
onwards.
Following Akiha-sama's orders, the code for the main
gate to the mansion has been changed.
If you use this keycard, you can unlock the gate, even
at night."
<Page15>
"Whoa, Akiha didn't waste any time, huh..."
That was close... If I'd gone out without knowing, I
might've had to spend a sleepless night loitering
outside the front gate after I tried to return.
<Page16>
"That is all I have to say.
I will not stop you from going out at night, but I hope
that you will take great care not to get hurt."
Hisui makes one final bow and takes her leave.
<Page17>
"―――――Jackpot."
I received a helping hand right when I least expected
it.
With this, I should be able to sneak out of the mansion
without having to worry Akiha.
<Page18>
After eating dinner alone, I return to my room.
The time is almost ten o'clock at night.
"Right―――let's go."
I tuck my knife away in my pocket, and leave my room as
quietly as I can.
