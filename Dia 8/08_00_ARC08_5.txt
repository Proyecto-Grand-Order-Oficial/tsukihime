I return to the mansion.
The sun hasn't set yet, and there's still time until
Akiha returns.
<Page2>
"I wonder if Akiha's still mad about what happened this
morning..."
It's a given that she'd be upset about my conduct.
<Page3>
I haven't really been acting respectfully the whole
time I've been back at the mansion.
I like to think I could resolve everything by just
explaining the situation to her, but... there's no way
she'd believe me if I started going on about vampires.
For now, I'll just have to grit my teeth and play the
part of the reprobate older brother.
<Page4>
"Welcome back, Shiki-sama."
"Good evening, Hisui. Thanks for going out of your way
to greet me.
...Ummm, is Akiha not back yet?"
<Page5>
"Correct. She will be arriving particularly late
tonight, so I was ordered to let you eat dinner alone."
<Page6>
...I see.
That's a shame. I was hoping to at least have a chance
to chat idly with her.
I guess I'll just go back to my room and rest for a
bit.
<Page7>
"―――Shiki-sama."
"Hmm? What is it, Hisui?"
After quickly glancing around the lobby, Hisui calls
out to me once again.
<Page8>
"I know it is not my place to ask, but will you be
going out tonight as well?"
<Page9>
Hisui gazes straight at me.
She's clearly aware that I'm planning on sneaking out
of the mansion... but I don't think I have any cause
for concern there.
I mean, she's already noticed that I'm not in my room
every night.
It's natural for her to assume that I'd be heading out
tonight as well.
<Page10>
What does worry me is why she asked that question.
Even if she simply wants to know when I'll be back to
fulfill her role as a servant... Telling Hisui is
basically the same thing as telling Akiha.
<Page11>
...This isn't a question that I should treat lightly.
I―――
C:> ...Tell her the truth.
C:> ...Lie and try to fool her.
