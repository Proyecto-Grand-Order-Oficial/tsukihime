My day settles back into a familiar routine.
Fourth period, Modern Society.
The teacher on the podium reads aloud from a rather
bland, uninspired text.
I'm lucky enough to sit by the window, so as I calmly
listen to the lecture, I take a good hard look at my
own face reflected in the glass.
<Page2>
"........."
...I can't concentrate at all.
Not because the lesson is boring, but because I'm still
struggling to get to grips with the situation I'm in.
<Page3>
The conflagration in front of the train station that
claimed all those lives.
The invasion of the city by a vampire.
With those events in mind, as I sit here paying half an
ear to the lecture, I turn my thoughts on myself.
<Page4>
Needless to say, I've been acting strange.
Anyone else in my position would surely have barricaded
themselves in their home or fled somewhere far away by
now.
<Page5>
And yet here I am, going about my day as usual.
It's as though I'm trying to prove to myself that
vampires or no vampires, these events are merely
abnormalities, and hardly worth abandoning my daily
routine over.
<Page6>
...Though, if I'm being honest...
It could just be down to the fact that as a student, I
simply can't permit myself to skip school.
<Page7>
I recall the conversation I had with Saiki Gotou back
at the mansion.
If I were to put it in his words, studying is an
investment in the future.
It would be monumentally short-sighted to sacrifice the
compound interest of tomorrow in exchange for a paltry
sum of safety today.
<Page8>
Besides, it's Tohno family money that keeps me fed and
watered. If I'm going to be living under their roof,
then I should be sure to perform at least the bare
minimum that is required of me as a student. Not out of
obligation, but as a matter of honor.
<Page9>
I wonder if such an attitude makes me servile, or
stubborn?
It's also possible I'm simply thickheaded.
Sensei once told me to 'become the person that you
think is right'.
If I'm to continue to live by those words, then I must
be sure to treasure each and every ordinary day that
passes.
<Page10>
I squint at the sunlight streaming through the window.
Only twenty more minutes until the end of fourth
period.
Classes let out after fifth period today.
<Page11>
I think about how as soon as school ends and night
falls, I'll once again be out roaming the city, side by
side with Arcueid.
The face reflected in the glass breaks into a smile, as
though looking forward to something.
<Page12>
"―――― ."
I straighten my expression.
It's not like I enjoy prowling around the city with
Arcueid all night, so what the hell am I smiling about?
<Page13>
"...Geez..."
I knew I was having a hard time concentrating on the
lesson, but I didn't think I was  far gone.
I must be pretty out of it if I'm starting to
hallucinate visions of that woman elegantly swanning
across the school grounds.
<Page14>
―――Wait, that's no hallucination!!!
<Page15>
Being careful not to disrupt the class―――or rather,
being careful not to let any of the other students
notice what's going on―――I edge a little closer to
the window.
Please tell me that there's just something wrong with
my eyes...!
<Page16>
Yeah, that's no illusion.
Much as I'd love to pretend she's some figment of my
imagination, the woman in the courtyard is anything
but.
Does that vampire have nothing but cotton between her
ears!?
<Page17>
What should I do? What's  going to do? If I leave
her to her own devices, who knows what horrors will
befall my peaceful student life.
<Page18>
"........."
No, calm down. Everything is okay. We don't have a
problem just yet.
The other students haven't noticed her, and I don't
hear any commotion from the neighboring classrooms
either. Fortunately, she seems to be situated such that
she's only visible from this classroom at the moment.
<Page19>
I swear to god, that woman is a destroyer, through and
through...!
At my wit's end, I curse her from the bottom of my
heart.
However, doing that doesn't solve anything.
<Page20>
There's twenty minutes left until lunch.
If I leave that airhead vampire alone, there's no
telling what kind of mess she'll create.
<Page21>
I―――
C:> Do my utmost to intercept her.
C:> Do my utmost to focus on the lesson.
C:> Do my utmost to ignore her.
