I'm curious about Arihiko's story, but in the end, it's
just an abandoned building that's a whole two stations
away.
It probably has nothing to do with the vampire that's
lurking in Souya.
It's not like I have the stamina to go there anyway.
I'll just return to the mansion and prepare for the
night ahead.
