"Before you eat, there is something we must discuss.
Please, take a seat on the sofa."
<Page2>
They are stern words, ones that I cannot disobey.
Phrases such as 'you reap what you sow' and 'a foolish
brother ought to die' revolve inside my head.
...I guess I have no choice but to make my stand and
accept my fate.
<Page3>
"...Alright, but please keep it brief if you can."
I defeatedly take a seat on the sofa across from Akiha.
<Page4>
Kohaku-san prepares a cup of tea for me without a
moment's delay.
It gives me a small amount of courage, as if she was
silently telling me 'hang in there'.
<Page5>
That's right. Akiha may be the family head, but she's
still my younger sister.
This shouldn't end up being a totally one-sided match.
I take a sip of the black tea and lock eyes with her.
<Page6>
"So, what did you want to talk about?"
"Did you engage in sexual intercourse with the woman
from last night?"
"―――!"
<Page7>
Not good―――choking, I'm choking.
Damn it Akiha, you're not supposed to go throwing
fastballs right out of the gate.
I nearly choked to death on my tea.
<Page8>
"Nii-san. Are you listening to me?"
"I'm listening. I can hear you loud and clear."
<Page9>
"If that's the case, then answer me.
Tell me about the woman from last night, accurately,
without deceit, and in as much detail as you can
without making me upset."
<Page10>
"If those are your conditions, then there's nothing I
can say."
"Even though I just warned you not to make me upset?"
So those were her warnings, not her conditions...!
<Page11>
"...Man, this is really starting to feel like an
impossible task..."
<Page12>
"What's that? I couldn't hear you because you were too
quiet. Please speak up.
Exactly who is that woman to you, Nii-san?"
<Page13>
"If I had to say, we're collaborators. Or friends...
sorta? Or rather―――"
<Page14>
"Hmm. Rather close friends for the two of you to be
going out at night like that.
Yes, I have no opinion on who you choose to have a
future relationship with, but isn't it true that you're
still a student?"
<Page15>
"For the eldest son of the Tohno family to――― well,
rendezvous with an unknown woman night after night.
Shouldn't you refrain from such indecent acts?"
<Page16>
...I see. So that's how our relationship looks to her.
<Page17>
"Hold on, Akiha. First things first, we don't have that
kind of relationship.
All I'm doing is helping her find something. Once
that's all over and done with, there'll be no reason
for us to see each other again."
<Page18>
"...That's odd, considering how awfully close you
looked, but you're suggesting that was simply my
imagination, Nii-san?
Are you telling me that your relationship with this
person is temporary and purely transactional?"
<Page19>
Akiha's gaze is cold.
If I just nod yes, this conversation could end
peacefully.
...But I feel strangely reluctant to affirm that
statement.
Although we both have something to gain by working
together, I find it hard to say that's all there is to
it.
<Page20>
"Well I mean... we're not exactly , but it's not
like I'm helping her purely for mercenary reasons
either."
"Of course. After all, I've never seen you in a panic
like that before. For my otherwise serious brother to
reveal his emotions, naturally I would wonder what on
earth could have brought that on."
<Page21>
"I didn't panic that hard, and I'm not emotionless
either. I was just surprised because I didn't expect
her to visit our house."
"Really now? Even though that woman remained totally
calm the entire time she was waiting for you?"
<Page22>
Akiha gives me a sidelong glance, as though she has
something more to say.
It seems like she thoroughly believes that Arcueid and
I are going out.
<Page23>
"Hey Akiha. Could you stop with the misunderstandings?
Besides, the only reason we know each other is
because―――"
<Page24>
I stop myself from saying it's because I killed her.
...It's not like she would believe me even if I did
tell her the truth. And besides, there's no way I could
let her know about that sort of thing.
That being said, I couldn't come up with a better
explanation, so, just like last night, all I could do
was mumble some vague words.
<Page25>
"If you cannot answer that question then perhaps I
should pose a different one.
You've been consistently referring to her as 'that
woman' for a while now, but what exactly is her name?"
"Her name is... Arcueid."
<Page26>
"Is that so? Then that means you two didn't meet at
school. There are no exchange students at your high
school after all."
<Page27>
"―――"
Just as Akiha says, there isn't a single
foreign-exchange student at our school. ...Wait, why
does she know that?
<Page28>
"And so, how exactly did you two come to know each
other?"
"W-We met each other in the city. By chance."
<Page29>
"By chance, you say. So then Arcueid-san was the one
that called out to you, correct?"
"Ah―――well, actually it was me who called out to
her..."
The truth is that there was no calling out to anybody,
only murder. After that came the chase. Anyhow, I was
the one who started it.
<Page30>
"Why did you call out to her?
I thought there was nothing between you and
Arcueid-san. Or are you saying that wasn't your
intention at first?"
<Page31>
Akiha's question was truly precise.
Step by step, she's honing in on my weak point.
<Page32>
I'm like a deer standing transfixed in the path of
oncoming headlights. Sooner or later, I'll be pushed to
a point where I can't deceive her anymore.
...It's depressing, but it is what it is.
At this point, I should end this conversation even if I
have to use force.
<Page33>
"Oh come on, I'm telling you there's nothing between
us!
Besides, what I do with my life has absolutely nothing
to do with you.
As for being the eldest son of the Tohno household, we
both know that's just for show. It shouldn't be a
problem even if I were to go out with someone."
<Page34>
I know it's unfair to bring up the fact that I was
disowned, but she's not likely to back down unless I
resort to something like this.
Akiha raises her eyebrows, and then―――stands up
without making a sound.
<Page35>
"Hmm?"
...That's odd.
I thought that she'd have a ruthless counterattack in
store for me, but contrary to my expectations, Akiha
turns away, an uneasy expression on her face.
<Page36>
"It's not like I wanted to have this conversation
either.
I just... have a bad feeling about that person. If it
were anyone else, I would have simply dropped the
matter. However, when I see you let your guard down
around that person, I can't help but feel like I'm
being foolish."
<Page37>
...I don't get it.
Akiha spoke through pursed lips, visibly frustrated.
<Page38>
"What's wrong, Akiha? You're acting a bit strange."
"That's enough. If that's what you really want to do,
then do whatever you please...!"
<Page39>
With an uncharacteristically violent stride, Akiha
takes her leave of the living room.
<Page40>
"Geez. How could you, Shiki-san.
I feel sorry for Akiha-sama. If you're going to invite
a lover over, at least bring one that's a little more
normal.
If you had done that, then I'm sure even Akiha-sama
would have given her approval."
<Page41>
Kohaku-san lets out an exaggerated sigh and chases
after Akiha.
