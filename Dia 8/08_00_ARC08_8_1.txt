", it's useless―――!"
<Page2>
"―――!"
The moment I take a defensive posture, Noel kicks off
from the ground.
My knife's range is no match for her spear's.
Before I even have a chance to react, the pommel of her
spear slams into my side.
<Page3>
"...!"
It hits me with such force that my vision whites out.
I feel myself get thrown almost a meter.
<Page4>
I hold back the pain and shift myself to take the fall
safely.
I hit the asphalt back first, but manage to soften the
impact with a roll. However, Noel is already right in
front of me again...
<Page5>
"That won't do, Shiki-kun. Telegraphing your intent in
front of the enemy like that is so naïve, it makes me
laugh.
I'm a bit of a coward, so I accidentally put all of my
strength into that strike, are you still alive?"
<Page6>
"... ."
I go to lift myself up with my hands, when―――
"...!"
Noel drives one of her heavy boots into my chest.
<Page7>
"Please just stay still for me, okay~? Don't get the
wrong idea and start thinking that we're lovers now. If
you don't behave, I'll snap that neck of yours like a
twig ♡"
"―――"
<Page8>
I just lie there on the floor, glaring at Noel.
I can't wrap my head around this situation at all.
But even so, her thirst for blood is no joke, and it's
clear that I'm the one she has in her crosshairs.
<Page9>
"Shit, so you were a vampire as well!"
"―――What did you just say?
Did you call me a vampire just now? Are you saying that
I'm the same as those monsters?"
<Page10>
"...!"
The pressure on my chest increases.
This reaction... She seems legitimately angry that I
called her a vampire...?
