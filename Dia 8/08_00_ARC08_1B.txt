"―――Ah."
The moment I open the door, memories of last night
resurface and flash before my eyes.
<Page2>
Amazing. I astound even myself.
I really ought to get my head checked. Maybe they can
work out what quirk of my mental makeup made it
possible for me to forget such a terrifying event.
<Page3>
Though, that's only if I make it out of here alive.
I stand frozen in place like a statue, hand still on
the door, unable to take a single step inside.
<Page4>
Meanwhile, in the living room...
As though reprising her role from last night, Akiha is
sitting on the sofa.
<Page5>
Kohaku-san is standing a little ways behind her.
Normally, no matter how prickly of a mood she's in,
Akiha still greets me with a 'good morning, Nii-san'.
But today, she's acting like I'm not even here.
<Page6>
"......"
It goes without saying that it was last night's
dereliction of my duty to explain my connection with
Arcueid which has earned me this treatment.
<Page7>
It may seem like Akiha is relaxing gracefully, but the
pressure she's exuding is no joke.
The tension in the living room right now is so thick
that you could cut it with a knife.
<Page8>
"Good morning, Shiki-san#.
Would you like some tea before breakfast?"
...Well, at least one person here is unconcerned with
all this.
<Page9>
"G-Good morning, Kohaku-san. Maybe I'll take you up on
that tea later, once things have calmed down."
I return Kohaku-san's greeting and enter the living
room.
Akiha gives me a sidelong glance as I gingerly creep
into the room.
I'm not going to falter in the face of this silent
pressure.
<Page10>
Times like these are the true tests of one's mettle.
I...
C:> Greet her cheerfully.
C:> Greet her quietly.
C:> Had better start apologizing.
