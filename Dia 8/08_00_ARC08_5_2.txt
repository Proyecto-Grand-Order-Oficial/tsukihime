I feel bad for Hisui, but there's no way I can tell her
the truth.
What I do with Arcueid ought to stay a secret.
I can't tell them I'm on the hunt for a vampire that's

"No, I'm not planning on going out at night anymore.
Especially not after the scolding Akiha gave me this

Hisui isn't in a position to keep pressing me on it

After dinner, I hole myself up inside my room.
The time is almost ten o'clock at night.
Taking greater pains than usual not to be spotted, I
make my way outside.
