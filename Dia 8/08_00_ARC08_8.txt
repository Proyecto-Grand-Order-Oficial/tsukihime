<Page1>
I climb all the way up the hill from the residential
area and finally arrive at the outskirts of the
mansion.
It's just after two o'clock in the morning.
I'm struggling to keep my eyes open at this point.
<Page2>
"...I wonder if she's really okay."
The way Arcueid was behaving back when we parted has me
a little worried.
I get the feeling it wasn't just because her wound was
acting up, or that she was tired, but―――
<Page3>
"Hmm?"
What was that?
There, in the space between two streetlights. In that
pool of darkness the light can't quite reach, stands a
figure―――
<Page4>
――――――.
The first thing I felt was fear.
It was such a surreal sight that it made my heart seize
in my chest.
But unfortunately for it, I've recently built up quite
a tolerance against the fantastical.
My heart quietly starts beating again, and I
surreptitiously grasp my knife in my right hand.
<Page5>
――――――.
I feel my circulation switch into overdrive. Am I
hallucinating?
That's clearly a human being.
I simply can't make them out properly, that's all.
Their silhouette just looks a little off.
<Page6>
They're getting closer and closer.
. . .
I hear their rasping footsteps.
They stare at me with their one open, bloodshot eye.
<Page7>
――――.
I unleash the blade of my knife.
I put a hand on my glasses.
I feel a chill slowly creep down my spine.
With one more step, the figure will pass the point of
no return.
Suddenly―――with a click, the streetlights all go
out.
<Page8>
Even though the moon is definitely out tonight.
The world is suddenly plunged into darkness.
.
I feel my heart reverberate in my chest, as though it
were sounding my death knell.
A steel blade hones in on the line running down my
upper left arm.
Conscious thought will have to take a back seat for
now.
<Page9>
Before the blade scything through the darkness could
connect, I swing my knife up from below and deflect the
tip of the blade, staving off the attack.
"―――."
The shadowy figure's lips curl. If I were to think
about it, I'd understand that they're smiling.
But first―――
I must intercept every strike of that deadly weapon...!
<Page10>
"...!"
I'm surprised, sure. But my thoughts are calm. It
doesn't feel like a single second has passed since the
moment I saw this figure. My thoughts stopped. Time
froze. The fact that I'm being attacked this very
moment doesn't even register as noteworthy.
<Page11>
Sparks fly as the two deadly weapons clash in the dark.
A darkness so profound we each can't make out the
appearance of the other.
And yet, even in the midst of that darkness,
the bonds of life shine ever so clearly.
<Page12>
I accurately predict and parry each swing of the blade
with my knife.
―――But there's one thing that does seem noteworthy.
Despite the darkness, despite the relentless onslaught
of that deadly weapon, this body of mine is able to
stop each and every strike.
<Page13>
Maybe their moves are just that easy to read?
It's a possibility... No, that's not it.
My arm is simply zeroing in on the lines and points
that I can see with my bare eyes.
They are the only things I can see, so I'm just
swinging my blade at them as fast as I can.
<Page14>
My head.
My head hurts.
My thoughts glow white hot.
My chest twists in pain.
My head hurts. The old wound in my chest is burning.
My eyes feel like they're about to fall out of their
sockets.
<Page15>
But I've experienced all this before.
Something just like this definitely happened, long ago.
It was... Ah, that's right.
The bloodstained corpse of a child.
The bloodstained, crying face of Akiha.
The bloodstains―――on my own two hands.
<Page16>
The impact of knife clashing against knife.
My instincts take over, and I knock the blade aside.
That was close. I let my mind drift for a moment there.
But I won't make the same mistake twice.
That's because I know what he's aiming for now. Now
that I do, I don't even need to think―――I can cut
them off on instinct.
<Page17>
How do I know? It's simple.
Every attack of theirs has targeted one of the 'lines'
on my body.
As such, I don't need to try and predict where they're
going to strike next.
I just need to keep up my guard, keep distance between
us, and prevent them from taking aim at my most
vulnerable 'lines'.
<Page18>
As soon as I realized that my strategy was based around
that fact...
"Bastard―――you can see them, can't you?"
I finally understood that this 'somebody' can see the
same things I do.
<Page19>
――――.
The figure's laugh echoes through the darkness.
They stare at me with those bloodshot eyes, sneering at
me for taking so long to realize.
<Page20>
"―――."
My heart pumps faster still.
My lips curl upwards as an indescribable mixture of
ecstasy and fear brews within me.
I see. In that case, we're even. Getting cut would mean
instant death for me as well.
<Page21>
"――― ."
Not that it matters. Why even think that now? I'll die
no matter where I'm cut. But I wouldn't be standing
here now if I were craven enough to run from something
like that. I mean, Vlov was really something, with
those cold waves of his. This person is nothing
compared to that vampire. That's right. Even if by some
chance you're the one Arcueid is after...
Under these conditions, I'm definitely better than
you―――!
<Page22>
Attack.
Attack.
 the one on the offensive now.
This person is doing all they can to fend me off. In
other words―――I'm not the one with my back to the
wall. They are.
<Page23>
――――Victory will be mine.
I don't know who they are. I don't know where they're
from. But I'm sure of it.
Right now, I'm the one who's in control.
I feel goosebumps. My overwhelming advantage is
exhilarating.
I can win. I'm stronger than this person.
I'm stronger than them.
That's why if they were about to kill me, I should just
kill them right back.
<Page24>
I strike their weapon, sending it flying.
I take a step forward. The 'line' I must cut is right
there on their chest, defenseless. I thrust my blade
forward like a fang.
Ah, but it's strange.
Why, in a situation like this, does my hand not
hesitate to swing this deadly weapon―――?
<Page25>
"Huh―――?"
As if in response to the return of the streetlights, my
once fervid thoughts abruptly return to normal.
<Page26>
There is no one in front of me.
The figure that I was trying to kill just a moment ago,
was pierced in the stomach by a long, thin object and
sent flying toward the wall around the mansion.
<Page27>
―――I can't follow what just happened.
The figure that attacked me... I guess it was a man...
His body was skewered by a pipe-like object that flew
in from the side.
<Page28>
He must have been hurled all the way to the wall by the
impact.
If he's human, that blow will have been fatal.
But it's abundantly clear that this man is anything
but.
<Page29>
"―――Don't get in my..."
A hoarse voice.
Wheezing heavily, the man with the skewer stuck through
his stomach glares up into space.
Keeping a safe distance, I follow his gaze.
There―――
<Page30>
A familiar figure is standing on top of a streetlight.
<Page31>
"Noel... sensei?"
She's dressed like a priest from overseas.
In her right hand she carries a thin blade,
and with her left grasps an enormous spear that sticks
out like a sore thumb.
<Page32>
...I know that shape.
No, a part of me remembers seeing something like it
before.
Back during the fight with Vlov, that blade was the one
that saved me from those blocks of ice... I understand
that fact without really being aware of it.
<Page33>
"――――――"
Our eyes meet.
The woman standing on top of the streetlight smiles at
me, and then...
she hurls several of the thin blades in her hand at the
shadowy figure.
<Page34>
"O temple, appear."
At those words, a light rises from the ground.
<Page35>
The hum of a blade slicing through the air.
She raises her massive spear at the ready,
and leaps off the streetlight, aiming straight at the
man below.
<Page36>
"!"
The man screams as he is cut in half.
The shadowy thing that clung to him is swept away by
Noel's giant spear.
Just like the grotesque dead from the parking lot, the
figure melts away, together with the shadow.
<Page37>
Through it all, the man continued to glare straight at
me.
His bloodshot eyes were filled with nothing but killing
intent.
It was as though those black pupils were weapons, and
Tohno Shiki the sole object of their ire.
<Page38>
"―――――"
I could do nothing but stand there in blank amazement.
The man, and the shadow that clung to him, have
disappeared.
...Not a single trace remains, they were simply wiped
clean off the face of the earth.
<Page39>
The cry of insects. The rustle of the wind. The
rightful sounds of the night reassert themselves.
Even after that sinister scream, the surroundings sink
back into the darkness of the night, as if nothing had
ever happened.
<Page40>
...Except for the distinctly out-of-place person now
standing in front of me.
<Page41>
"Good evening. I'd heard that this country was safe at
night, but this seems to be a bit of a bad
neighborhood. I was just out for a stroll when all of a
sudden I stumble across some vampire-like monster,
harrying a cute little student of mine.
Or perhaps―――things like this simply tend to happen
when you're around, Tohno Shiki-kun?"
<Page42>
The woman in the nun's outfit turns around.
Without concealing her overflowing hatred and clear
desire to see me dead, she smiles at me.
...There's no doubt about it.
This person is the same Noel that recently started
teaching at our school.
<Page43>
"Noel-sensei―――Well, I wonder if I should still call
you that?"
". That's a great question. I don't mind the sound
of 'sensei', but we aren't at school, are we? I think
it'll be easier for both of us if you drop the
'sensei'."
<Page44>
I hear the sharp echo of her footsteps.
Noel advances on me.
With a smile still on her face, but that dreadful spear
still in her hand, she begins to close the distance
between us.
I―――
C:> ...Confront her as an enemy.
C:> ...Stay cautious but alert.
