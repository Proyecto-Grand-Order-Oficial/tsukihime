In those days, the mansion was a giant playground.
The forest, a deep ocean.
The house, a towering castle.
The gardens within those grounds would have taken an
uncountable number of days to fully explore.
We reveled in it all.
<Page2>
Every day was fun.
We didn't know anything about growing up,
and the notion that we would carry on in this way, day
in, day out,# was something we never questioned.
It was a childhood of puppy-like exuberance.
We got along so well that we became inseparable
playmates.
<Page3>
Every time we looked back, Akiha was there.
And whenever we waved, she would hide out of
embarrassment.
Yeah, that's how things always were.
<Page4>
In those days, the mansion was a giant playground.
The forest, a deep ocean.
The house, a towering castle.
A closed-off world that would have taken an uncountable
number of days to fully explore.
We reveled in it all.

I wake up slowly.
The morning light chips away at my lingering
drowsiness.
As I lay there...
I somehow felt as though I'd seen a nostalgic dream.
<Page6>
"..."
No sooner do I wake up than something unpleasant
intrudes upon my field of view.
<Page7>
A sharp headache gouges deep into the flesh and bone
beneath my temple.
This morning is so vivid, it's as though the sun had
fallen into the garden.
Its powerful rays dye the entire room.
<Page8>
"... ."
Right, my glasses. I put strength into my arm to reach
for the glasses on my nightstand, but it doesn't budge.
There's no feeling in my limbs. I can't will them to
move at all. It seems like the only part of my body
that's actually functioning is my mind.
<Page9>
"――――――"
Unable to even close my eyes, I simply let the time
tick away.
<Page10>
The harsh light softens.
I regain feeling in my limbs.
I take a deep breath and, finally, stifle this sight by
putting on my glasses.
<Page11>
"―――――."
I breathe out and lift myself upright in bed at last.
<Page12>
It's no big deal.
I used to suffer spells like that fairly often back
when I was in the hospital.
A temporary deterioration in eyesight induced by
exhaustion, with an accompanying paralysis of my limbs.
As if that wasn't enough, it also does away with my
appetite.
If I spend too long looking at things with my glasses
off, it's a given that I'll end up paying for it like
this.
<Page13>
"But even so, this time―――"
I feel like I can see them more clearly than I used to.
The lines on buildings are difficult to see. Even when
I can make them out, they're normally quite thin;
seeing them as distinctly as I can right now is pretty
unusual.
The lingering remains of my headache feel just like a
gunshot wound.
<Page14>
Sensei said something back then.
That it's possible my eyes could call forth something
bad.
Arcueid warned me not to use my eyes too much.
She said to do so would be to destroy my brain―――to
destroy Tohno Shiki himself.
<Page15>
"........."
This is the price I pay for getting involved with
vampires as a human.
The risks I'm taking aren't confined to the times I'm
actually going toe-to-toe with a vampire, I'm putting
myself in danger every moment of every day.
<Page16>
...I'm not about to start second-guessing myself now. I
knew what I was getting into when I decided I wanted to
help Arcueid.
<Page17>
"...That's right. Things like this aren't that big of a
deal."
<Page18>
Besides, even if I were to bury my head in the sand, it
wouldn't change the fact that I'm caught in the middle
of this turmoil.
We'll wipe this city clean of vampires.
If I want to protect Akiha and those close to me, I
have no choice but to lend Arcueid a hand.
<Page19>
"Okay."
I psych myself up and leap out of bed.
I'll get changed right away, then thank Hisui for last
night―――
<Page20>
"Huh――――?"
Speaking of Hisui, she's nowhere to be found.
It's past seven o'clock in the morning.
This is around the time that she'd normally be calling
out to me from the side of the room to wake me up.
<Page21>
"...I wonder if she overslept."
An unlikely explanation, as my school uniform has still
been neatly prepared on top of the desk.
<Page22>
Perhaps she simply had other matters to attend to.
I'm curious what, but it's none of my business.
Besides, I don't have any time to spare this morning.
I'd better change into my uniform quickly and head down
to the first floor.
