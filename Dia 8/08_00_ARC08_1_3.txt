After what happened last night, there's no way I can
just talk my way out of this.
Any excuses I make now will just be adding more fuel to
the fire.
Therefore, I have no choice but to go in with a
full-speed, full-throttle apology.
I need to cut in with a vigorous 'I'm sorry' before she
has the chance to interrogate me.
<Page2>
"So about last night, that was―――"
"Nii-san, may I offer you a word of advice?"
<Page3>
―――She cuts me off.
Her voice is so frightening that it sends a shiver down
my spine.
<Page4>
"Remember that you are the eldest son of the Tohno
family, so I would not apologize lightly if I were
you."
<Page5>
"An apology is something you do when you accept that
you are at fault.
And if you are at fault, then as much as it saddens me
I must mete out a punishment befitting the eldest son
of the Tohno family."
Her smile is so sadistic that it's very possible I
misheard her saying 'much as it gladdens me'.
<Page6>
Hmm. If I can't even seek forgiveness by apologizing,
then the only thing left for me is to be killed.
Right, time to scram.
<Page7>
"Sorry, Akiha. As the eldest son of the Tohno family, I
would like to go to the dining room to get breakfast,
is that okay?"
It's about time I retreat to the dining room.
"Nii-san.#"
Akiha's curt voice brings me to a halt.
