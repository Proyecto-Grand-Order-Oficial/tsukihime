After climbing all the way up the hill, I finally
arrive at the main gate of the mansion.
It's just after two o'clock in the morning.
I'm struggling to keep my eyes open at this point.
<Page2>
"Huh? Crap, the gate is shut."
Someone's gone and locked the gate on me.
The last few times I left the mansion at night, it was
still open by the time I came back...
<Page3>
"I could have sworn that I turned off the auto-lock..."
It's possible that they may have changed the lock
system.
<Page4>
In any case, I'm in trouble.
It wouldn't be impossible to climb in over the fence,
but doing so would probably set off an alarm. I'd also
prefer to avoid 'killing' the lock and opening the gate
that way.
If I did that, I'd be able to count on being summoned
to a family meeting over it tomorrow. I should use my
eyes only as a last resort.
<Page5>
"This mansion's gotta have a back gate somewhere..."
<Page6>
"... ―――"
I lean my back against the wall and take a breather.
I was in the middle of searching the perimeter of the
mansion when the day's fatigue finally caught up to me,
leaving me somewhat lightheaded.
<Page7>
...This is a good sign that my anemia is starting to
act up. My breathing is also getting a little labored.
What I need right now is to lie down somewhere, but
unfortunately, my current circumstances aren't
particularly accommodating in that regard.
<Page8>
I haven't stumbled on anything that looks like a back
door yet.
The wall around the mansion seems to stretch on
forever. I'm finally starting to appreciate just how
sprawling the Tohno estate really is.
<Page9>
It looks like I'm going to have to follow the road all
the way around, climb up the hill, and make my way in
through the forest... According to the map on my phone,
that's a good three kilometers or so.
<Page10>
"I hope I've still got enough energy for that..."
More importantly, I would have preferred not to have to
walk through the dark forest alone.
The road at least has streetlights, whereas the inside
of that forest is going to be pitch black.
The mere thought of creeping around it in the dead of
night is enough to send a shiver down my spine.
<Page11>
"Hmm?"
What was that?
There, in the space between two streetlights. In that
pool of darkness the light can't quite reach, stands a
figure―――
<Page12>
――――――.
I feel my circulation switch into overdrive. Am I
hallucinating?
That's clearly a human being.
I simply can't make them out properly, that's all.
Their silhouette just looks a little off.
<Page13>
They're getting closer and closer.
. . .
I hear their rasping footsteps.
They stare at me with their one open, bloodshot eye.
<Page14>
――――.
I unleash the blade of my knife.
I put a hand on my glasses.
I feel a chill slowly creep down my spine.
With one more step, the figure will pass the point of
no return.
Suddenly―――with a click, the streetlights all go
out.
<Page15>
The moon is hidden by the clouds.
The world is suddenly plunged into darkness.
<Page16>
"!"
―――――――...!
I feel my heart reverberate in my chest, as though it
were sounding my death knell.
The dizziness makes my feet feel heavy. It's like I'm
wading through mud.
I try to jump back, but my body is too slow to react to
my thoughts.
<Page17>
Under cover of darkness, the blade swings.
I hear a squelch as the flesh above my heart is split
open.
<Page18>
"―――?"
―――I don't understand.
All I know is that a knife has been thrust deep into my
chest.
<Page19>
For a brief moment, the moon peeks through the clouds,
revealing the figure of the man.
<Page20>
An eerie figure, shrouded in a black haze.
Ah―――I remember you...
That was the last scene that I ever saw.
