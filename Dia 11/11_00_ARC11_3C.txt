I'm in a deep sleep.
I'm having a dream in which Arcueid has woken up before
me, and is doing something bad.
<Page2>
She seems to be skulking around on her own, getting
ready to put her mischief into motion.
I try to ask her what she's doing.
<Page3>
"Huh? Shiki, you're awake?"
Yeah, but I'm still a little spaced-out.
Thanks to Arcueid, my body is not yet able to move as I
want it to.
<Page4>
"―――I see. I'm happy, but also a little
embarrassed."
...Arcueid smiles girlishly.
I find it a little strange that I can understand her
gestures even with my eyes closed, but she looks so
happy that I abandon such trivial questions.
<Page5>
"Hey, Shiki?"
What's with the serious tone?
You're worn out too, you should just sleep until night
falls.
<Page6>
"If, you know... if I turned into a real vampire, what
would you do...?"
...That's a weird thing to ask.
But that would never happen.
After all, she's afraid of drinking blood.
<Page7>
"―――That's why... this is just a what-if.
We talked before about how snuffing out the life of
another living creature in order to survive is the
natural order of things. That's why―――
If, hypothetically, I ended up like that..."
Stop it.
There's no way that would happen, and I'm not a fan of
what-ifs. I told you that clearly before.
<Page8>
"Really? I like what-ifs.
You might not know where you're gonna end up, but in
the moment you always feel like there's some kind of
salvation out there."
Ah...
Now that I think about it, this isn't the first time
you've brought this up.
<Page9>
"Yeah. That's why―――I wonder what I would've done if
you hadn't turned out to be so kind."
...Ar...cueid...?
<Page10>
"―――I love you, Shiki.
It's thanks to your kindness that I can feel this way,
and that I can put this feeling into words."
...She's...
Arcueid is... crying, isn't she...
<Page11>
"So, before you wake up, I'm going to go.
I couldn't say goodbye face-to-face. Please forgive
me."
...The door closes with a click.
While I slept.
I dimly heard that noise.
<Page12>
"―――."
I open my eyes.
The sun is shining brightly, even through the curtains.
I look over at the clock and see it's just turned noon.
<Page13>
"Crap, school!"
I bolt upright.
...Hold on, today's Saturday.
<Page14>
There's no need to worry about going to school. If
there's something I should be worried about, it's that
I spent the night in Arcueid's apartment without
contacting the mansion.
<Page15>
"―――――"
Oh yeah, I feel like I had a weird dream.
A dream where I spoke with Arcueid, and at the end, she
gave me a kiss.
<Page16>
".... I must have a screw loose or something."
I guess seeing pleasant dreams like that is further
evidence of just how happy it makes me to be here, next
to Arcueid as she continues to doze in bed.
<Page17>
"Wouldn't you agree, Arc―――"
I turn to look at the bed.
My voice catches in my throat.
<Page18>
"―――Ar...cueid?"
I stare at the bed, dumbfounded.
There's nobody there.
Arcueid's figure is nowhere to be found.
―――'With that, I'm off.'
In my dream―――
She said something like that.
<Page19>
"W-Wait!"
I scour the apartment.
There's no sign of Arcueid. It's like she was never
here.
<Page20>
The only thing I did find―――
Was a solitary scrap of paper left on the table.
<Page21>
"Wha―――"
Is this some kind of joke? What language is this?
On that scrap of paper is written a single word: .
<Page22>
"―――What, the..."
I don't want to believe it.
But what's worse―――is that I can understand why
she's done this.
<Page23>
"―――How could she?"
...You've got to be kidding me.
She can't leave with nothing more than an ''.
Not after making that promise.
Even though she promised we'd stick together, even
though I told her I'd stand by her until the bitter
end―――
Why―――Why are you going back to being alone―――
<Page24>
"Why the hell, Arcueid―――!"
Screaming at the top of my lungs, I crush the piece of
paper.
<Page25>
And then―――
I dart from the room, and run around the city like a
man possessed.
<Page26>
...I won't find Arcueid.
I know that.
I'm painfully aware that she'll never appear in front
of me again.
<Page27>
―――Even so, I can't just give up.
I'll lose my mind if I do.
I need to catch her so that I can chew her out for
being such an idiot, but try as I might, I can't find
her.
At this point, it's certain that we'll never meet
again.
<Page28>
"―――."
Whatever we had, it's over. Irrevocably so.
She's gone to settle the score with Roa alone, and
after that she'll disappear.
...No, she probably already handled all of that and
left the city long ago.
<Page29>
"―――――――"
I lost the ability to think straight even before I went
mad.
...I hear the shrill cry of a cicada echoing in my ear.
A cicada's... cast-off shell.
My body feels so insubstantial. So hollow. I'm no
longer able to even think.
<Page30>
So this is what it's like for your soul to leave your
body.
Not even tears will come.
Devoid of everything, my legs begin to move.
The homing instinct of an animal.
Nothing is left in me, and yet, I start walking.
Returning to my own bed.
