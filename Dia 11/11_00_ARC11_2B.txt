I head back to the mansion.
I didn't go to Arcueid's apartment.
She probably wouldn't even have been there if I had,
and besides, I have something else I should be doing.
I'll catch her after that.

"Welcome back,# Shiki-sama."
Hisui greets me as soon as I come in the door.
"I'm home.# Thanks as always, Hisui."
I sincerely thank her for her thoughtfulness. She
must've been waiting all this time. I've caused a lot
of problems for Hisui by not taking that thoughtfulness
into account.
That's why, even if just for today, I wanted to do
things by the book and return to the mansion before
sunset so that she can fulfill her duties.
After having dinner with Akiha, I leave the dining
room.
I think I was able to play the part of an older brother
well enough. The conversation between Akiha, Kohaku-san
and I was both down-to-earth and spirited. ...Well,
compared to how things used to be, at least.

I return to my room and pack up my belongings.
Well, I say 'belongings', but it's really just my
textbooks.
The knife that's ended up being part of my everyday
carry is already tucked away in my inside breast
pocket, so the only other things I need to grab are my
phone and the white ribbon.

"―――Alright."
I tidy my room and take a deep breath.
I never would have guessed that I'd be bidding my own
room farewell again so soon.
<Page5>
I fully intend to return, but you never know what might
happen.
It doesn't hurt to say my thanks now, just on the
off-chance I never make it back.
<Page6>
I turn off the lamp.
It's half-past nine.
The perfect time to leave the mansion.
