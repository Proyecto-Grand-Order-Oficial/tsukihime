<Page1>
I arrive at the park just before ten o'clock.
There's not another soul in sight.
I sit down on a bench and wait for Arcueid to arrive,
mindlessly waiting as though I'm just here to count the
seconds as they tick away.
<Page2>
I considered running around the city like I did last
night.
But I'm sure it wouldn't be of any use.
I mean, if she goes out of her way to avoid running
into me, I have no hope of catching her.
<Page3>
"Yeah. That's why, I'll just wait here."
We made a promise, after all.
We decided together to rendezvous here.
We still haven't fulfilled tonight's promise.
<Page4>
I can't just crumple that promise up and throw it away.
If Arcueid also considers it important, she'll come
back here too.
Continuing to believe and wait, that's the best
atonement I can offer.
<Page5>
Time marches on.
The hands on my watch carefully and accurately mark the
passing hours.
<Page6>
"―――――――"
It's gotten so late. I feel like I'm suffocating.
My body can't bear another minute of waiting.
It wants to race off and start searching for her at
once, not just sit here and wait like an ornament
propped on a shelf.
<Page7>
"―――――――"
Despite that, my mind is calm.
In the middle of the night, I stare fixedly at the moon
and continue to wait.
<Page8>
―――It's terribly quiet.
It's like she and I are the only ones left in the
world.
If I can wait for her in a world like that, then no
matter how many hours it takes―――even if I end up
waiting forever―――I won't feel any pain.
That's why I'm so happy right now that I can hardly
breathe.
<Page9>
The moon that had been twinkling overhead is beginning
to dim.
Three hours left until daybreak.
If the sun rises, it'll all be over for sure.
Never again will Arcueid and I spend the night
together, feeling this sense of contentment.
<Page10>
―――Or so it feels, anyway.
<Page11>
"......"
I let slip a pitiful sigh.
Was it a sigh at the ridiculousness of this situation?
Or a sigh of dejection? Even I don't know.
<Page12>
Well, I guess it doesn't really matter.
Amidst the shadows behind the pavilion, I've been
catching the occasional glimpse of a figure in white.
It seems the person in question is trying to conceal
themselves, but are absolutely hopeless when it comes
to stealth.
<Page13>
"Hey, it's already three in the morning. Just how long
were you planning on keeping me waiting, dumbass?"
Without standing up from the bench, I call out to the
other side of the pavilion.
"."
I hear a poorly stifled gasp.
<Page14>
After a few seconds―――
I guess she gave up on trying to hide, as she suddenly
pops out into the open, like a rabbit appearing in a
snowy field.
<Page15>
"............"
Arcueid doesn't say anything.
She doesn't approach the bench I'm sitting on either,
she just stands there with her eyes downcast.
"―――Arcueid."
I call her name, but she doesn't even look up at me,
let alone respond.
<Page16>
".................."
I'm at a loss for what else to say.
The words I'd been piecing together in my mind all
vanished the moment I saw that face.
<Page17>
Damn it. I just don't know what I can say that'll bring
a smile back to her face.
I get the sense that no matter what I say right now,
it'll only make her even sadder.
<Page18>
...
......
.........
It feels as though this moment is stretching on
forever.
In reality, probably fewer than a hundred seconds
expire under the second hand of my watch.
Arcueid suddenly looks up, as though something has
caught her attention.
<Page19>
"Shiki, you just won't go home, will you?
I ended up coming because I couldn't stand to leave you
like this... I really was planning on just going back
to my apartment, you know."
<Page20>
Her voice faltered slightly here and there as she
spoke, but for the most part, it carried the same
cheerful tone it had always held.
<Page21>
"Yeah, I'm not going home. You said we shouldn't see
each other anymore, but that's got nothing to do with
this.
We promised to rendezvous here. Aren't we gonna take
down that vampire together?"
"――――――"
<Page22>
That's why―――I want you to stop making that face.
I find myself desperately wanting to shake off my own
self-restraint, and just capture her.
<Page23>
"I can't believe it. You're still talking about that?"
"Yeah. I said I wouldn't break our promise, didn't I?
I haven't helped you yet tonight."
<Page24>
"It's fine. You don't need to worry about it anymore.
You should go on home.
As for Roa, I'll deal with him one way or another."
<Page25>
"It's 'fine'? What's 'fine', Arcueid?"
"Doesn't it go without saying? I'm a vampire, you're a
human, it's as simple as that.
I don't even deserve your help. I should never have
asked you to cooperate with me."
<Page26>
"...Because I couldn't even realize that, I very nearly
ruined you.
That's why―――"
'That's enough', I hear her mutter.
<Page27>
"――――――"
I suppress the urge to scream.
―――Why even mention that now?
I've been prepared for that eventuality from the moment
I said I'd cooperate with you.
I knew what I was getting into when I made that vow.
But ending things like this―――where's the good in
that?!
<Page28>
"...Arcueid.
If it's about what happened here, then you don't need
to worry about it.
Your body is weak right now, and you were just a little
worn out.
Because I'm an idiot... I didn't notice your lies. It
wasn't your physical injuries that were tormenting you,
it was your vampiric urges. You didn't act the way you
did because you actually wanted my blood."
<Page29>
"Damn them. When did the Burial Agency get so chatty."
Arcueid lets out a sigh, her expression more tired than
hateful.
<Page30>
"...Yeah, I've heard everything. And now that I have,
I'm gonna tell you something.
It's not a problem you can't overcome, Arcueid.
It's tough right now, but won't you be back to normal
in a few days?
So there's really no need for you to worry.
And that night―――even though it was agonizing, you
were able to endure it, weren't you? That's why it'll
be okay. You can keep on going, same as you did
before."
<Page31>
"........."
Arcueid manages a frail, forlorn smile.
<Page32>
"You just don't get it at all, Shiki.
It's impossible, now that it's come to this.
Because even now, I'm probably still craving your
blood."
<Page33>
"―――But you're unsure. So give it all you've got and
fight it.
I mean, that's how you've been keeping it together
until now, right?"
<Page34>
"...You're right, I have been keeping myself in check
like that until now. Or rather, I was  to keep
myself in check that way.
But, it seems like it's no use now.
Despite my only purpose being to kill vampires, I ended
up doing all sorts of unnecessary things. I really am a
fool."
<Page35>
"If only I'd remained blissfully ignorant, I never
would have desired anything. I should've just gone
after the enemy myself, without relying on you.
If I'd done that―――I would've been able to settle it
by myself."
<Page36>
"―――――"
...Ah, it's no good. Going up against her really does
bring out the worst in me.
I mean, what she just said has got me really pissed
off.
So much so it makes me want to cry.
<Page37>
You'd have been better off doing it alone...?
I don't care whether it's an outright lie or just a
bluff―――don't go spouting that garbage while making
a face like that!
<Page38>
"God! You're getting on my nerves with that crap!
That's enough from you, Her Majesty, Princess of
stupidity!"
Tearing my hair out, I stand up from the bench and
scream my head off at Arcueid.
<Page39>
"W-What did you just call me? Princess of stupidity!?"
<Page40>
"I sure did. If that's not enough for you how about
world-class idiot, maybe even galactic dimwit? Anything
you can stick 'biggest fool in the-' before works! What
the hell do you mean you could've 'settled it
yourself'?
Wasn't it because you realized that it was impossible,
that there are some things that can't be done alone,
that you asked me for help!? If it was, then rely on me
until the end...!"
<Page41>
"I'll help you. No matter what, regardless of what you
say or do.
I'll help you to the end, so―――"
So... please, for your own sake―――
"Never again... please don't say things like 'that's
enough' ever again."
<Page42>
...Not now.
Not now that she'd finally begun to think that life can
be fun.
I don't want her to let go of that simple happiness so
easily.
<Page43>
"Shiki―――#are you... crying...?"
"Of course not...! Why would I be crying for your
sake...?!"
<Page44>
Even supposing my eyes are wet right now, it's just
because I'm angry.
Arcueid was spouting such absurd nonsense earlier that
my emotions got the better of me, that's all.
<Page45>
"Ah, forget it! Let's just keep searching for vampires
already!
If we kill that Roa guy then you'll be able to rest,
right?
If we do that, then everything will turn out fine!
There'll be no problems left!"
<Page46>
Not wanting her to see my moist eyes, I turn and talk
over my shoulder.
Quietly, and with awfully calm eyes, Arcueid nods her
head.
<Page47>
"But, it just won't work after all, Shiki.
You said that I was able to endure it back
then―――back when I touched the nape of your
neck―――but the truth is, I wasn't."
<Page48>
"...The only reason I stopped for a moment was because
you, Shiki, were afraid of me.
I've been feared by who only knows how many humans up
until now. Because of that, the revulsion they directed
at me had long lost all meaning."
<Page49>
"But... isn't it strange? When you looked at me like
that, I just couldn't stand it. At the end of the day,
I'm a monster in your eyes, aren't I?"
She chuckles.
A dry, forced laugh.
<Page50>
"You're wrong. I wasn't scared of you or anything.
It was just... so sudden that I got a little
surprised―――"
...A lie.
A lie I couldn't even fool myself with.
Arcueid averts her gaze, a pained look in her eyes.
<Page51>
The kind of lie Sensei warned me about.
A lie you can't even fool yourself with will only hurt
the people close to you.
<Page52>
"...That's the reason I stopped for that instant.
I was terrified of you seeing me that way. If you were
to look at me again with those eyes, I'd definitely
fall apart.
So I thought―――I shouldn't meet with you anymore.
That that'd be the best for both of us..."
"―――――――"
<Page53>
"Thank you for waiting for me, Shiki.
But with this, our rendezvous are over.
I think we've... gotten too close."
<Page54>
Suddenly, she turns her back to me.
It was as if she didn't want to see my face as she
spoke those words.
<Page55>
What she said is certainly true.
If the two of us hadn't gotten to know each other so
deeply, this would never have happened.
I'd have easily fallen back into the routine of my
ordinary life, and Arcueid would have gone on alone, as
she always has.
―――And neither of us would be worried about the
other.
<Page56>
"You're right, we really have gotten too close.
But I think that's just fine.
I mean, isn't it lonely to always be out there on your
own?"
Arcueid does not respond.
I see her shoulders tremble, if only for a moment.
<Page57>
"You don't need to worry about this city. I'll
definitely kill Roa. Even if I end up going down too,
I'll definitely kill him.
That's why you can stop now. This city will return to
its original state, there'll be no reason for you to
worry anymore."
<Page58>
The voice over her shoulder doesn't have any of its
normal cheerfulness.
...I can't bear it anymore.
I'm done with just standing here and listening.
<Page59>
"Dummy. That's not what I'm worried about at all."
I approach Arcueid.
"Ah――――"
I reach out to that fleeing back, place a hand on her
shoulder and forcibly turn her around.
<Page60>
"Shi―――ki."
"If I have to come out and say it for you to
understand, then so be it.
Listen, when I said I would help out, it wasn't about
taking down the vampires that have been running amok in
this city.
In reality, I never had any such grandiose motivations
about wanting to protect the city I live in."
<Page61>
I may have lied and said that I did, but I was just
trying to convince myself as much as anyone else.
It was nothing more than a shameless excuse.
I simply...
<Page62>
"It's simple: it's because I love you. It's because I
wanted to be of help to you that I said I'd work with
you.
And at this point―――I can't just pretend I don't."
I say it clearly.
I wrap my arms around her, and hold her trembling body
close.
<Page63>
"Ah――――"
There was no opposition in Arcueid's voice.
Dumbfounded, standing perfectly still, she accepts my
embrace.
<Page64>
"If you think you want my blood, then that's just fine
with me."
At the soft sensation, I feel a burning thirst.
<Page65>
"Shiki... You're hurting me... My arm―――"
Her voice in my ear sets my heart on fire.
<Page66>
"In fact, it makes us even. You see―――"
With my gaze, I say the things that shouldn't be put
into words.
<Page67>
"I... I also think I've always wanted you.
Even here, like this―――hearing your heartbeat is
driving me mad with lust."
<Page68>
.
Emanating from the arms I'm holding tight, from the
body pressed against mine―――
I can feel the palpitations of Arcueid's heart.
<Page69>
"You've got it wrong, Shiki. Those feelings for me are
just... nothing more than a momentary obsession..."
"Even so, it's fine.
If in this moment I love Arcueid, then that's Tohno
Shiki's truth. I don't care what comes after.
Unless―――You hate me?"
<Page70>
――.
The rhythm of her heartbeat falters.
"...No. That question... won't be answered."
I no longer feel her heartbeat.
Instead, I feel her arms wrap tightly around my back,
as if in response.
<Page71>
At first, it was gentle.
But soon it became so fervent as to be more than just
an answer.
Arcueid drew me close with both arms, squeezing my body
against hers.
<Page72>
The embrace lasted but a moment.
I'm not even really sure myself who ended it.
But, as if by some unspoken agreement, we release our
entwined arms to meet each other's gaze.
<Page73>
"............"
Arcueid's head remains bowed, but she's blushing
nonetheless.
Moved by her expression, I let out a sigh of relief.
<Page74>
She's really here, right now, right in front of me.
I'm certain that the two of us will never again be
apart.
<Page75>
"I'm so glad. I finally caught you, Arcueid.
To be honest, I was terrified. I did something
unspeakable to you back then. Even while believing
you'd keep the promise we made, I knew there was a
chance that I might never see you again."
<Page76>
"――――"
Arcueid's hair flutters.
She lifts her head as if she has something to say, but
as soon as she meets my gaze she looks away again,
blushing.
<Page77>
"That won't do, Shiki.
Even though I said... to forget about it..."
Arcueid's voice is frail.
"Ah―――――――"
Just how much more insensitive can I get?
Arcueid was trying to avoid bringing up what happened
in that alley out of consideration for me.
<Page78>
"...I'm sorry. I was a fool. I guess I don't have the
right to call you one anymore, do I?"
"That's not it... If there's someone who needs to take
responsibility, it's me. That's why I said to forget
about it."
<Page79>
...I don't believe it. Maybe she isn't a vampire after
all, but some sort of succubus.
How the hell am I supposed to forget when she looks at
me like that?
<Page80>
"No, you're wrong. I'm not saying I'm an idiot because
of what happened last night. What makes me an idiot is
that no matter what I do, I can't forget the things I'm
better off not knowing."
"Shiki―――?"
<Page81>
"You know, from this morning I've done nothing but
think of you.
How was I going to apologize when I met you? What was I
gonna say? I spent the whole day thinking about it.
And yet, even while I was thinking about how to
apologize, I couldn't get what happened back there out
of my mind. I started having foolish thoughts about how
I wanted to touch you just one more time―――no, over
and over again."
"――――"
<Page82>
Arcueid averts her gaze from me.
I'm the same way―――I can't look straight at her
anymore.
Realizing I might've just said the unspeakable, I can't
look her in the eyes.
<Page83>
But... it's the honest truth.
It wasn't Arcueid's Mystic Eyes that made me do what I
did.
I was just crazy about her, and I still am.
<Page84>
There's no reply from Arcueid.
We were each waiting for the other to say something,
and so the silence just stretched on.
<Page85>
"...Well, if we're both being honest..."
Her words come hesitantly.
Shyly, as though quietly owning up to a prank―――
<Page86>
"I wasn't able to forget either, Shiki."
While gazing directly into my eyes, she says those
words.
<Page87>
"!?"
Crap.
I embraced her a little too forcefully.
But who could blame me?
If a face like that doesn't drive you crazy, you'd
better just resign from your post as a living thing.
Well... anyway...
<Page88>
"Sorry, for hugging you so suddenly."
I really am an animal, aren't I?
I hear a soft chuckle escape her lips.
Leaning into me, Arcueid wraps both her arms around my
back once more.
<Page89>
"Shiki... I'm impressed."
She pulls me tight with her arms.
This sensation... I feel like I'm melting.
<Page90>
"Uhh... Impressed? Care to elaborate?"
"You're so rough! You're more barbarous than any Dead
Apostle I've ever come across; I couldn't help but
laugh."
Ah. I'm sorry, I'm all too aware of that myself.
<Page91>
"But... it's funny, isn't it? Killer boy and victim
girl embracing each other like this."
"...?"
As she whispers that, Arcueid's body starts trembling.
Is her wound hurting...?
<Page92>
"You okay, Arcueid?"
"Yeah... I'm just happy, I guess.
I'm overflowing with emotions right now, my body is so
flooded with relief it's like I've lost control over my
cheeks. I don't even know what sort of face I'm making
right now.
―――Hey, Shiki... Can you tell what sort of face I'm
making right now?"
<Page93>
"How should I know? I can't see your face while we're
hugging.
...Well, except―――"
I squeeze my arms around her just a little tighter.
With just the right amount of force, I hold Arcueid
close.
<Page94>
"Except, I'm sure that I'm making the same one.
I've been grinning like an idiot for some time now."
We laugh, our bodies pressed together.
It isn't lust so much as a strong joy that warms our
chilled bodies.
<Page95>
"―――Hey, Shiki."
I hear her whisper directly in my ear.
She murmurs to me with a drowsy peacefulness in her
voice―――
"If you're going to protect me...
I don't... want you to go home tonight."
<Page96>
She buries her face in my shoulder.
There's only an hour left until dawn.
The night is fading. Arcueid's time is over.
I feel the same way. There's no way I could bear to
part with Arcueid now.
