――It's morning.
I grab my glasses from the bedside, put them on, and
open my eyes.
The sky visible through the window is a peaceful shade
of blue.
<Page2>
"........."
Despite it being such a bright and beautiful morning,
my own feelings are shrouded in darkness.
There's no need to ask why.
The sight of Arcueid's profile as she apologized to me
remains lodged in my brain.
<Page3>
'Let's just both forget―――'
Forget what?
The assault in the alleyway?
Or about Arcueid entirely?
<Page4>
...Either way, it's impossible.
I can't forget a single thing about her.
<Page5>
I stare fixedly at my hands.
My fingers still remember Arcueid's body.
The feeling of her smooth skin.
Her rising body heat.
<Page6>
My regrets are innumerable. If she'd killed me right
then and there, I wouldn't have blamed her.
<Page7>
...Even so. Nothing will change the fact that I acted
selfishly.
At that time, why couldn't I just think rationally?
What if, instead of pawing at her like an animal, I'd
caressed her as a human being? If I had―――
<Page8>
"――――――."
I grind my teeth at my selfish thoughts.
It wasn't the sight of Arcueid's golden eyes that made
me lose myself.
The simple truth is that at some point, I started being
serious about her.
<Page9>
Without really knowing why, I was completely charmed.
For a long time now―――probably ever since the moment
she said she'd forgive a beast like me―――I've been
crazy about her. I don't give a damn about Roa. She's
the only thing that matters.
Though―――
<Page10>
'I think it's best if we don't see each other anymore.'
<Page11>
I can't get that lonely smile out of my head.
It's really too late.
If only I'd realized sooner―――I'd never have given
her a reason to make that face.
<Page12>
It's a morning like any other.
Hisui comes and wakes me up.
I head to the living room, where I run into Akiha and
Kohaku-san.
After making some small talk, I leave for school.
<Page13>
It's just like it always is.
I had put my life on the line to protect these ordinary
moments.
I should be satisfied. I didn't lose anything.
<Page14>
And yet, I feel incredibly hollow inside. Whenever
anyone spoke to me, I could only reply absentmindedly.
I left the peaceful mansion on autopilot, like a
machine, just going through the motions.
<Page15>
All of the students filtering through the main gate
seem so cheerful.
Everyone is abuzz with excitement at the prospect of
tomorrow's day off.
"Huh. I guess today is Friday."
I'd been so busy keeping up with Arcueid the past
couple of days that I completely lost track of what day
of the week it is.
<Page16>
It was on a Friday morning that I first met her.
She'd been waiting for me right here, at the
intersection in front of the school.
"...She was smiling, wasn't she?"
<Page17>
She was like that from the start.
Even though she was waiting to ambush the bloodthirsty
stranger who had killed her, her eyes were sparkling
with excitement.
<Page18>
"...I wonder why. I wish I could ask her."
But I missed my chance.
Never again will she come to the park at night.
<Page19>
I take my seat.
Five minutes left until homeroom#.
Nothing to do now but stare aimlessly out at the
schoolyard.
<Page20>
"Whoa, good morning. You playing hooky all the time was
pretty conspicuous. Did you decide to get serious?#"
"......"
I let out a heavy sigh.
This is where we'd normally hurl abuse at each other,
but I just don't have it in me this morning.
<Page21>
"What's up with you? You don't look so good. You didn't
even come to school yesterday, and when you do decide
to show up, you're a shell of a man. It's no fun coming
to school if you're like this, no sir."
Arihiko shrugs his shoulders exaggeratedly.
<Page22>
"Sorry, but can you leave me alone today? Even if you
don't have me, you've still got Senpai. Actually, isn't
having me out of the picture a lucky break for you
there?"
<Page23>
"Huh? Senpai? I don't know any third-years."
"...What do you mean you don't? I'm talking
about―――#"
<Page24>
I trail off mid-sentence.
...What Senpai was I thinking of?
I don't know any third-years, same as Arihiko.
<Page25>
"Oh, homeroom is starting.# See ya at lunch."
Arihiko sneaks out through the door at the back of the
classroom.
As he leaves, in comes Noel-sensei... or not? It's the
teacher from the next class over.
<Page26>
"Huh? Makuma-sensei? This is class 2-C, you know. You
take a wrong turn somewhere?"
"Oh no, I'm in the right place. Your teacher# up and
quit this morning, so, well, here we are."
Our laid-back math teacher breaks the news to us in a
dull voice.
<Page27>
"No way! Noel-sensei's gone!?"
"You can just quit being a teacher that easily!?"
"She couldn't even last a week. Geez, talk about being
too free-spirited."
"I knew that cougar was just another slut!"
A wail goes up from the young men that were in the Noel
faction.
I just nod along absentmindedly.
<Page28>
It's got nothing to do with me.
It's not worth my time.
I've already accepted that everything's over.
<Page29>
The woman called Noel only came here posing as a
teacher in order to keep an eye on me―――or rather,
to check if I was Roa.
If she's disappeared, that means there's no longer
anything of interest to her here.
<Page30>
I've been thoroughly cut off from the world of
'vampires'.
The final thread connecting Tohno Shiki's world to
Arcueid has been severed.
