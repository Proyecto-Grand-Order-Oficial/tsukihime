<Page1>
Arcueid's apartment is the same as ever.
We're the ones who have changed.
...I can feel her presence behind me.
I'm so worked up that if I turn around, I'll end up
doing something.
<Page2>
And yet, my mind is clear.
I don't really get it, but...
I guess to love something is to hold onto these
contradictory impulses, to simultaneously stay sane and
lose your mind.
<Page3>
"―――Arcueid."
I go to turn around.
But as I do―――Arcueid lightly touches my back.
"Don't turn around. Let's just stay like this... for a
little while."
<Page4>
...Arcueid's voice is calm.
The hand she placed on my back stays perfectly still,
as though to reaffirm that this is real.
<Page5>
"Hey, Shiki. Do you remember the first time we met,
when I waited for you?"
"Of course I remember. The person I killed was lying in
wait for me with a smile on their face. No way I could
forget that."
<Page6>
"Yeah. You know, at the time―――
I... really hated you."
In contrast to her words, Arcueid's voice is incredibly
gentle.
<Page7>
"―――I already knew that I couldn't hold back my
vampiric urges much longer.
I chased after Roa, knowing that this was almost
certainly my last chance.
But right when I thought I'd finally found him, some
stranger killed me. Everything was ruined.
At that time, I was filled with nothing but hatred."
<Page8>
"Driven by it, I tracked down my killer, and then
waited for you to come. I waited on that road for so
long.
Come on, hurry up and get here already. I was itching
for you to show up and notice me so that I could make
you suffer the exact same fate.
...I really hated you.
I kept on waiting, my hate building and building, until
it felt like my heart would burst."
<Page9>
The hand on my back presses harder.
"...Ar...cueid...?"
<Page10>
"But you know, nobody had ever killed me like that
before. I started to get just a little curious about
what kind of person they might be.
On top of that―――I'd never felt so strongly about
anyone before."
<Page11>
"At the start, I only felt hate. But when I started
wondering what you were like, my emotions got all
turned around.
I couldn't bear to wait a second longer, I wanted to
meet you already.
The person who killed me so brutally, who made me lose
sight of myself for the first time―――the person I
just couldn't stop thinking about."
<Page12>
"Shiki, about what you said earlier―――that being by
yourself is lonely. I'd never thought that way.
But, thinking about that lunatic―――the feeling of
impatiently waiting for you to show up already, that
was true happiness."
<Page13>
"At the time, I really wanted to rush off and find you
myself, but I'm glad I waited for you to come to me.
The time I spent waiting was fun. I was really excited,
wondering what sort of person you were. Letting my
imagination run wild."
<Page14>
Arcueid withdraws her hand from my back.
<Page15>
"...Now that I think about it―――
Ever since then, I've felt like I needed someone, like
being on my own isn't enough anymore.
You said you love me, but―――
...Before I'd even met you, I'd already fallen in love
with you―――"
<Page16>
There is nothing but tenderness in Arcueid's voice.
...There's no longer any need to hesitate.
I turn around, and unreservedly embrace her.
<Page17>
"..."
Our lips meet on their own.
I'm not sure which of us wished for it. Maybe both of
us did.
A simple, tender kiss.
We press our lips together as if trying to bring our
existences even closer to each other.
<Page18>
...I hold my breath, and take in the feeling of being
in contact with Arcueid.
Her soft lips.
The touch of skin on skin, in places where we had never
come in contact before.
Even though these thoughts are enough to make my head
feel like it's going to explode, I let out a deep sigh
of relief as I embrace the warm sensation of her body.
<Page19>
Arcueid is quivering softly.
But it's not because she's afraid.
Her closed eyes, her flushed, rosy cheeks; she is
unbearably adorable.
<Page20>
...Her breathing is hot and shallow.
Arcueid is wholly enraptured.
I could never have imagined that this alone would make
her seem so much lovelier than she did before―――
<Page21>
Our lips gently part.
Our arms still woven together, we stare into each
other's eyes.
<Page22>
"...Just now... that was, a kiss..."
She stares up at me with those red eyes.
Her golden hair dances softly before me.
<Page23>
"Arcueid... do you... not like this?"
"No... I'm just really flustered."
.
I can certainly hear her heart pounding in her chest.
...And I can feel mine, beating just as hard.
<Page24>
"But, I'm a little worried.
Was I... good?"
"Was what good?"
<Page25>
"...Ah. Well, you know, Shiki...
Vampires don't join their lips like this, you know."
Her cheeks are red.
She spoke shyly, as though incredibly embarrassed.
<Page26>
"You―――"
With that move, it's checkmate.
My mind goes blank. I no longer even know that I'm a
human called Tohno Shiki.
<Page27>
I collapse onto the bed with Arcueid still in my arms.
I go to touch her skin, to run my hands through her
hair―――
But I stop short.
<Page28>
Damn, I'm breathing too heavily.
I won't make the same mistake a second time.
No matter how much I want her, I can't just give in to
my own emotions at the expense of hers.
<Page29>
...Arcueid looks up and sees the face I'm making.
"It's okay, Shiki. Shall we... pick up from ?"
Trembling with a mixture of bashfulness and anxiety,
she smiles up at me with eyes full of joy, as if to
overcome those feelings.
<Page30>
―――Our breathing overlaps.
―――Our skin melts together as one.
Our frenzied emotions have laid our hearts and bodies
bare.
We explore each other, at times greedily, at times
delicately, as if trying to plumb the depths of each
other's emotions.
<Page31>
"―――."
With a deep breath, I sink back onto the bed.
...Man. I may be saying this as someone that doesn't
dream, but that experience was dreamlike.
<Page32>
Arcueid is lying next to me, asleep#.
Her breathing is peaceful, and she's grasping my hand
contentedly.
<Page33>
"...."
...Looking back, I'm a little embarrassed.
I don't feel a smidgen of regret about embracing
Arcueid.
It's just―――
I wanted to savor the feeling of her skin, her blushing
face, for even a little while longer.
<Page34>
"...I guess I'm not ready yet. It takes all I've got
just to keep up."
...I wonder if there'll ever come a time when I'll be
able to remain calm around Arcueid's body.
<Page35>
I mean just now, I really don't even remember what I
did.
Literally, all I can remember is that it felt better
than anything I'd ever experienced before.
Regardless of how good it felt, the truth is that if I
took another step right now, I'd collapse from
exhaustion.
<Page36>
"―――."
Stifling my yawn, I watch Arcueid's sleeping face.
<Page37>
I really love her.
And Arcueid responded to that one-sided feeling.
The exact nature of it may be a little different from
the love I feel, but I'm sure she needs me too.
<Page38>
That alone is enough to make me incredibly happy.
Not just because I'm wanted by someone―――
But because Arcueid, who has been alone all this time,
has finally come to rely on someone else. That's what
truly makes me happy.
<Page39>
"Yeah. If she does, then from now on―――"
I feel faint as my consciousness begins to slip away.
...In spite of myself, it seems like this is my limit.
<Page40>
I turn onto my back, take a deep breath, and relax.
I must have been tired beyond belief. My consciousness
immediately sinks without a trace.
