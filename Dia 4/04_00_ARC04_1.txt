...I wake up in the gray daylight.
I no longer hear the sound of raindrops.
The rain has stopped, but the sky still looks cloudy.
<Page2>
"―――."
I take a deep breath and prop myself up in bed.
<Page3>
...I couldn't sleep properly last night.
Every time I was about to fall asleep, 'that scene'
replayed itself in my mind and woke me back up.
<Page4>
"...A bright red floor, pieces scattered everywhere..."
Reason and memory are inconvenient in times like these.
They try to remind you of all the things you want to
forget.
<Page5>
"...This is ridiculous. That was a dream, how many
times am I going to have nightmares about it?"
<Page6>
...Yes, it was just a dream.
I want to forget about it as soon as possible.
<Page7>
There is a knock at the door.
The clock reads just before six.
...Who could it be this early in the morning?
<Page8>
"Excuse me―――#Shiki-sama?"
<Page9>
"Pardon me. I see that you are awake."
<Page10>
"No worries. I'm sorry for surprising you too. I've
been asleep since yesterday evening, so I woke up
early.
...So, what's up with you, Hisui? You're here pretty
early. Did something happen?"
<Page11>
"........."
Hisui falls silent, seemingly perplexed.
Looking closely, I notice my school uniform in her
hand.
<Page12>
"Did you bring me a change of clothes?"
"...Yes. Once again, I apologize.
For making you see something so unpleasant."
"Hm?"
Hisui doesn't say anything more.
...I don't remember seeing anything particularly
unpleasant, but I'm not going to get hung up on it.
<Page13>
"...Anyway, thanks. You can leave my uniform there.
I'll change and head down to the living room in a
minute."
"Understood. Now if you will excuse me."
<Page14>
Hisui heads for the door without a sound.
...However.
She stops short just in front of the door, and abruptly
turns around.
<Page15>
"Shiki-sama... well, if you have time, I can prepare a
bath for you."
"...A bath, in the morning?"
<Page16>
"Yes, you are quite dirty. I suggest you clean yourself
before heading to school."
<Page17>
...Now that she mentions it, I do feel a little grimy.
Apparently I spent a decent chunk of yesterday
collapsed in the park with anemia, so I guess it's not
that surprising.
<Page18>
"You're right. I'm sorry, but would you mind?
It's early enough that I shouldn't have any problem
making it to school on time."
<Page19>
"Understood.
Please come to the bathroom in around twenty minutes."
<Page20>
Hisui sets my uniform down and leaves the room.
The time is still six in the morning.
I stare up at the ceiling of my room for twenty minutes
without doing anything.
<Page21>
After dousing my head with cold water, my sluggish
thoughts finally begin to sharpen.
I take a deep breath as the cold water drips through my
hair.
<Page22>
...It really was a disgusting dream.
I can't believe I dreamt about killing a woman that I
didn't even know.
I knew I was worn out from living in this unfamiliar
mansion, but if I've already reached the point where
I'm seeing dreams like that, it doesn't exactly bode
well for my future.
<Page23>
"...That's right. I have to pull myself together."
I dump another bucket of cold water over myself and
begin to wash.
"......"
The touch of the washcloth is enough to send a stinging
pain through my throat.
<Page24>
"...What is this?"
I look at my neck in the mirror.
...Weird.
My throat is red and swollen.
