―――I can't shake off my doubts.
Sensei told me something once.
'I'm not asking you to be a saint.
You can be the person you think is right.'
<Page2>
I know I'm not thinking straight at the moment, but I
can't betray her trust.
<Page3>
Arcueid may not be human, but she still believed in me.
She forgave Tohno Shiki's unforgivable sin with a smile
on her face.
If she can do that―――then I should be ashamed of
myself as a human being if I don't return that smile as
I offer up my own life.
<Page4>
"I'm an idiot...
I really am an incredible idiot...!"
<Page5>
I smack myself sharply on the cheeks and contemplate my
next move.
I get up from the bench.
I'm not going back to school or the mansion.
Without looking back, I start to run back toward the
hotel.
<Page6>
I return to the hotel, just barely making it back
before the sun sets.
<Page7>
"......"
I sneak back inside, treading lightly so as not to make
any noise.
If Arcueid is still asleep, then I shouldn't run into
any... problems...
<Page8>
"―――"
"......."
As you can see, she's already awake and fuming with
anger.
<Page9>
"Shi～～～～ki～～～～!"
"Uh, uhhh...!"
<Page10>
This is bad. This is  bad.
It would be clear to any onlooker that mademoiselle is
furious.
<Page11>
The Arcueid before me now is the one that made such a
fearsome scene in the alleyway earlier.
I may have surreptitiously run away... but I came back,
didn't I?! I shudder to think what sort of iron-fisted
punishment I'm in for now... If she isn't careful,
she'll split the whole hotel in half.
<Page12>
"N-No, the thing is, you see!?"
It's already too late to try and explain myself, but if
I end up getting killed without even attempting it that
would be even more shameful than having run away in the
first place, so I'll do my best to make excuses.
However...
<Page13>
"Oh, where have you been?
You should let me know before you go outside!"
<Page14>
"Huh...?"
This... isn't how I expected things to go.
<Page15>
"When I woke up at sunset, you were gone. You weren't
in the bathroom, so I thought you might have gone down
to the lobby to eat, but when I went to look, I
couldn't find you anywhere.
Just where have you been all this time?"
<Page16>
"........."
Arcueid is definitely angry.
But it doesn't seem like her anger stems from thinking
I betrayed her.
<Page17>
"Well... I just stepped out of the hotel for a second,
you know..."
"Are you serious...? Now that the familiars have found
you, you're not safe anymore either. If you go
wandering around outside and get attacked by that black
panther again, how exactly do you plan on dealing with
it?"
<Page18>
I'm stunned...
Arcueid isn't angry about the fact that I wasn't here.
The thought that I might betray her and run away didn't
even cross her mind.
<Page19>
She's angry because she was worried about me putting
myself in danger by blithely wandering around on my
own.
<Page20>
"――――――"
I'm ashamed... I was so close to trampling on her good
intentions.
<Page21>
"Hey, Shiki, are you even listening to me?"
"Yeah... I'm listening. You're right, it was my fault.
I'm sorry I left without permission."
I bow my head sincerely.
<Page22>
"Huh...?# H-Hey, you don't have to apologize so
seriously..."
<Page23>
"A-Anyway, you're way too vulnerable. The enemy is a
vampire; you've got to be more careful."
<Page24>
"Or what, do you have a death wish or something? Are
you trying to get yourself killed or just piss me off?
If that's the case, would you like me to bat you into
the sort of spatial extreme that can't even be
described in human language, one where you'll get
tossed about on the decimal level like an atom
undergoing Doppler cooling?"
<Page25>
"........."
She says something so terrifying in such a benevolent
manner.
<Page26>
"Not a chance. Also, that's just called hell. Don't
underestimate human linguistic capabilities, you
idiot."
<Page27>
"Besides, you're just as vulnerable as I am, aren't
you? I mean... I've already killed you once, remember?
You've gotta be crazy to go to sleep with  as your
lookout.
You can't be sure that I won't do it again, can you?"
