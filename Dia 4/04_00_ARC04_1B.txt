I return to my room and change into my uniform.
It has just turned seven o'clock.
I take my bag and leave the room, marveling at how
restored I feel after simply having a bath.
<Page2>
"Good morning, Shiki-san. You're up early today.#"
After heading downstairs I happen to bump into
Kohaku-san just as she's leaving the living room.
<Page3>
"You're also looking somewhat refreshed.
Did you just have a bath, by any chance?"
"Yes, I actually just got out of the bath a minute ago.
I'm impressed, Kohaku-san. How on earth could you
tell?"
<Page4>
"It's quite obvious. Shiki-san, your hair is still a
bit damp.
I have to say you look even cuter when you've just had
a bath."
<Page5>
Faced with her carefree smile, I can't help but look
away.
...Being smiled at right now makes my heart ache.
<Page6>
"Wait just one minute for me, okay?
I'll prepare some breakfast for you right away."
"Huh―――?"
...Breakfast.
In other words, I'm going to be eating something.
<Page7>
The most trivial words remind me of the color of blood.
This morning, I have even less of an appetite than
usual.
<Page8>
"Let's see. Would you like a Western breakfast this
morning?"
"...Ah, sure. To be honest, I don't really mind either
way.
Hmm, breakfast... The bath was so nice that I forgot
all about it."
<Page9>
"Is that so? You didn't eat last night either. I was
musing to Hisui-chan earlier that maybe it was the
grumbling of your stomach that woke you up."
<Page10>
"No, I'd simply slept too much. I've been a light eater
ever since I was a kid, there have been plenty of times
where I skipped one or even two meals in a row."
<Page11>
" . Now that I look at you, you do have a nice,
lean body. Are you a vegetarian by any chance?"
<Page12>
"I'm not fussy about that sort of thing... though now
that you mention it, I think I only ate vegetables at
the Arima house."
<Page13>
After I'd left the hospital, the doctor warned me to
avoid any hard to digest foods, but I actually ended up
steering clear of meat for other reasons.
...Probably because it reminds me of the death of a
living creature.
<Page14>
"I see, so you don't have any specific preferences.
In that case, it sounds like I don't need to worry
about anything while preparing your meal. Alright, I'll
whip something up for you right away, so please wait in
the living room."
<Page15>
Kohaku-san spins around and starts scurrying back
toward the living room.
But I can't bring myself to swallow anything right now.
<Page16>
"...Oh, no need, Kohaku-san. I don't have much of an
appetite today, so I'll just head straight to school.
If you could relay that to Akiha as well, I'd
appreciate it."
With that, I turn and head for the front door.
However, as soon as I do,# someone grabs hold of my arm
tightly.
<Page17>
"Shiki-san!"
...This is unexpected.
Kohaku-san seems angry.
<Page18>
"What are you talking about?
Shiki-san, did you not look in the mirror this
morning?!"
"Well... I saw myself in the one in the bathroom..."
<Page19>
"You're lying. If you'd so much as caught a glimpse of
your face, you wouldn't be saying something like that!"
<Page20>
Looks like Kohaku-san is seriously angry.
...Thinking back on it, when I saw my face in the
bathroom it wasn't just pale, it was positively
ashen...
<Page21>
"Come on, it's not that bad. My complexion has always
been a little on the pale side, so I might look a
little off-color compared to some people but―――"
<Page22>
"No! You won't grow if you don't eat your breakfast! If
you don't have much of an appetite, I'll prepare you
something easy to digest, so please make your way to
the dining room."
<Page23>
Keeping a firm grip on my arm, Kohaku-san starts
frogmarching me toward the dining room.
...It doesn't look like I have much of a choice.
I'm seriously unenthusiastic about this, but I'll
accept her kind offer...
<Page24>
"Good morning, Nii-san.
How is your physical condition?"
<Page25>
Akiha's greeting sounds more reserved than usual.
She's lacking her usual bravado. She must be worried
about my health, in her own way.
<Page26>
"Good morning. As for my body, well, it's in pretty
good shape."
I return her greeting and take a seat.
"Now then, I will prepare some easy-to-eat rice
porridge for you.
Please wait a moment."
<Page27>
Kohaku-san moves quickly.
She steps back out into the hallway, no doubt headed
for the kitchen at the end of the west wing.
There are three of us in the dining room―――myself,
an uncharacteristically reserved Akiha, and Hisui, who
is standing by the wall.
<Page28>
"........."
...This is kind of awkward.
"Nii-san,# regarding last night.
Is it true that you collapsed in the park?"
<Page29>
"Yeah. I can't quite remember it myself, but if
Kohaku-san and Hisui say so, then it must be true,
right?"
<Page30>
"Honestly, please do not talk about it as if it were
someone else's problem.
You are physically weak, so if you ever feel like
you're in any danger, please contact the mansion. I
will send someone to pick you up right away."
<Page31>
"...Oh come on. There's no need for all that, it's not
like I'm still in elementary school. Even if I feel
terrible, I can still make my own way home."
"Then by that reasoning, you are still a child. After
all, you were unable to make it back here on your own
yesterday."
<Page32>
"...Yesterday was an exception. It's rare that it gets
that bad.
Also, I'm not some sort of weakling―――I just have
chronic anemia. There's no reason I should have to
worry you with it every time.
I just happened to get deathly unlucky with the timing
yesterday, that's all."
<Page33>
"Wha―――deathly? Please do not use such words
lightly!
You are talking about your own body, are you not!? You
only just returned to the mansion, what am I supposed
to do if you were to die...?"
"――――――"
Akiha is seriously ticked off.
I'm surprised to see her this uncompromisingly angry.
<Page34>
"You are too reckless.
Please take a little more care of yourself."
<Page35>
"I mean, it's not as though I'm doing anything that
unreasonable. I'm not a member of any clubs, and I
always do as the doctor orders. If you want me to take
even  care of myself, I guess I'd have to admit
myself to a sanatorium or something."
<Page36>
"Yes, that's about the level of care I'd prefer if at
all possible.
Perhaps I could buy an isolated island somewhere, and
send you there so you can reflect on what you've done."
<Page37>
Akiha sullenly averts her gaze and offhandedly proposes
something terrifying.
What makes it terrifying is of course the fact that
she's not joking. She's more than capable of doing
something like that.
<Page38>
"―――.
Fine. Nothing happened this time, so I will drop the
matter.
But there will not be a next time, Nii-san."
<Page39>
Having spoken her mind, it appears that Akiha is
finished with her outburst.
As for Hisui, she simply stood by and watched our
exchange, as still as a statue.
<Page40>
"......"
...This silence is awkward.
It looks like we still have some time before we can
eat, so I'll―――
C:> Ask about Akiha.
C:> Have a word about Kohaku-san.
C:> Ask about the mansion.
