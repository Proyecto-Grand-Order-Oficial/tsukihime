―――――――――White.
         A dazzling white.
         The color evokes nostalgic memories.
<Page2>
A hot summer day.
<Page3>
A blue sky with huge, towering cumulonimbus clouds.
The landscape shimmers in the heat.
The cries of the cicadas make me feel faint.
The sound of cicadas.
Both of my hands are a glossy red, as though they have
been splashed with paint.

The husks of cicadas litter the open ground.
This space is slowly being burned away―――
As though the sun is right on top of us.
<Page5>
A hot day in the middle of summer.
It's as if the world has turned into a frying pan.

Akiha is crying.
Akiha, who had always meekly trailed after me, is
overflowing with tears.
<Page7>
Apart from Akiha, there is one other child lying on the
ground.
The sun's rays bounce across my slick hands.
Ah. These hands...                 are cold.
The collapsed child                 is cold.
The blood spilling out is red.    It's warm.
<Page8>
"―――――"
The adults have arrived.
The collapsed child is dead.
The adults are screaming.
They shout at me, demanding to know if I killed him.
<Page9>
―――Even by the standards of something as ephemeral
as a dream, the vision I just witnessed was something
long gone from my memory.
<Page10>
"Shiki. Come on, wake up.
The sun has already gone down."
<Page11>
My body is being shaken violently.
I can hear an unfamiliar voice... and there's a cold
hand on my shoulder.
<Page12>
Arcueid is right in front of me.
It's pitch black outside the window.
I check my watch and see that it's around eight o'clock
in the evening.
<Page13>
"Huh...?"
"What do you mean 'huh'? I told you to wake me up when
the sun goes down, but you just went and fell asleep."
<Page14>
"Sorry... I guess I couldn't keep my eyes open."
How pathetic... I can't believe I fell asleep while
staring at Arcueid's sleeping face...
<Page15>
"Seriously. That's totally disqualifying behavior for a
guard.
I can't believe we were both asleep... You realize that
if we'd been attacked during that time, you and I both
would have died right?"
<Page16>
"Alright, I said I'm sorry, geez. Also hold on, weren't
you the one that said we're safe during the day?"
"You can never know for sure. They could have sent
familiars like the ones from this morning after us."
<Page17>
Arcueid is angry.
Of course, it's entirely my fault.
If I fall asleep while I'm supposed to be standing
guard, I'm no more useful than a scarecrow.
<Page18>
"Also, I'm a vampire too you know, Shiki.
How come you were able to just fall asleep like you
aren't even afraid of me? Couldn't you at least have
been a little too nervous to close your eyes, struck by
terrible awe, or something along those lines?"
<Page19>
"――――"
Alright... maybe  my fault is taking it a bit
too far.
This woman actually seems more upset by the fact that I
was able to sleep around her than by the fact that I
wasn't on guard duty.
<Page20>
"I wake up after regaining a little of my strength,
only to find you happily snoozing away.
You had let your guard down so much that I was
seriously starting to worry that I don't appear much of
a bloodsucker at all."
<Page21>
"What are you on about, you were just as vulnerable as
I was.
I've already killed you once, remember? You didn't have
any guarantee I won't do it again, but there you were,
sound asleep like a princess. Don't underestimate me
just because I'm a human."
<Page22>
I snap back at her, reminding her that a cornered rat
will bite a cat.
It was a pretty desperate attempt at an excuse.
