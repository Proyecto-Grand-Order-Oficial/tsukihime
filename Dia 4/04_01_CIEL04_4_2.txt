No matter how much she looks at me with those eyes, I
can't agree.
A woman who can come back to life even after being torn
to shreds, black panthers, burning corpses... All of
this absurd nonsense is way above my pay grade.
<Page2>
"Sorry... but I can't help you. I'm just an ordinary
student. I don't know what you were hoping for, but if
you're looking for a partner, look elsewhere."
"Hmm. Do  students normally go around slicing
women they don't know to pieces?"
<Page3>
She's got me there. If we're talking normal versus
abnormal, my eyes fall into the same category she does.
Even so... my eyes aren't  abnormal.
I was living an ordinary life, never veering off the
straight and narrow.
If only I hadn't met this unbelievable woman.
<Page4>
"No, you're wrong. I was a normal guy until I met you.
I'd never even thought about killing anyone, I was
doing just fine.
That's right... That time was just an exception. I'm a
bit of a deadbeat, sure, but if I'd never caught sight
of you then―――"
<Page5>
"Ahh, shut up already!"
<Page6>
"―――!?"
The pupils of her red eyes widen.
The woman's mood changes completely.
What a terrible chill.
Her glare alone was enough to make me feel like my
heart would stop.
<Page7>
"Don't get me wrong. You killed me.
By all rights, I ought to pull your head off right
here, but I'm sparing you for the minute since you seem
like you might prove useful later."
<Page8>
"―――――Ah."
What I'm about to say is no exaggeration.
With just a stare, the world is transformed into a
silent wasteland.
<Page9>
My parched throat and trembling fingers are instantly
frozen in place.
I am overcome by the <chill|f e a r  > that runs down my spine.
My instincts as a living creature are warning me.
<Page10>
       , they
scream.
The thing you're looking at right now is nothing more
than a killing machine in the shape of a person.
<Page11>
I can't breathe properly.
No, my body won't even let me make  unnecessary
movements.
Breathing. Looking around with my eyes. Moving my
fingers. None of it. If I so much as twitch, then my
body will be instantly pulverized by something
enormous.
This isn't an illusion. It's an inescapable future that
my instincts have sensed.
<Page12>
"―――――――――"
My limbs are straining, desperate to flee this instant.
                             ―――I don't want to die.
I do my utmost to keep my thoughts in order.
                             ―――I don't want to die.
<Page13>
I'm gonna die soon. If I run, I die.
If I stay here, I die. If I move, I die.
But sooner or later, fear will kill my reason.
But if I make a sound, my limbs will be done for.
        ―――That's it. I'll be killed no matter what.
<Page14>
That conclusion burns itself into my mind.
I'm trapped between two contradictory escapes.
<Page15>
I feel chills as my mind is whittled down and endlessly
folded in on itself.
Just as I began to think that this would go on forever,
I'm suddenly released.
<Page16>
"――― ."
I fall to my knees on the ground.
Released from the pressure, I hug myself.
<Page17>
Thank goodness... I'm still alive.
<Page18>
"How about it? I hope you understand your position a
little better now that I've made it clear to you."
<Page19>
As if I could understand a thing like that...
I can do nothing but look up at this monster,
desperately trying to keep my teeth from chattering.
<Page20>
"It's not a matter of whether you can or can't. If
you'll help me, I'll let you live. If you won't, I'll
kill you.
See, it's simple, isn't it? All I'm asking is whether
you want to live or die."
<Page21>
"――――――"
I can't speak properly.
But I'm already instinctively nodding my head.
<Page22>
"Alright. With this, we have a deal then."
The woman holds out her hand to me as I kneel on the
ground.
<Page23>
"I'm Arcueid―――well, it's a bit of a long name, so
you can just call me Arcueid.
I'm from the   caste of vampires, what sort
of human are you?"
<Page24>
I heave a sigh as I'm subjected to a self-introduction
unlike any I've ever heard before.
I'm not entirely sure whether it's a sigh of exhausted
resignation, or evidence that I've finally accepted
this unbelievable situation.
<Page25>
"I'm Tohno Shiki. Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm just
a student. I already mentioned this earlier, but I
really am of no use to you."
<Page26>
I take hold of the woma―――of  hand and
stand up.
She takes a long hard look at me, and then―――
She asks me to shake hands with her.
<Page27>
"I look forward to working with you, Shiki.
I'll be sure to have you take full responsibility for
killing me back then."
<Page28>
Arcueid smiles and holds out her left hand.
I'm sure there are many ways to make amends in this
world... But I'm probably both the first and last
person to take responsibility by helping the very
person I killed.
<Page29>
"Man... this really is insane."
But there's nothing I can do about it.
I reluctantly hold out my left hand and shake hands
with the woman in white who calls herself a vampire.
