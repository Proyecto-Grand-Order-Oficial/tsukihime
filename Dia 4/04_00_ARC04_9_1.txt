<Page1>
"......Alright."
I take a small, deep breath and shake off my doubts.
I look around the room for anything I could use as a
weapon, but find nothing.
Swallowing my hesitation, I take my knife out of my bag
and walk over to the door.
<Page2>
"―――Shiki?"
"I'm going to go find out what's happening.
Don't leave the room until I come back."
Arcueid seems like she wants to say something, but I
brush off her gaze and go out into the hallway.
<Page3>
The lights in the hallway are off. Something must be
wrong with the electrical system.
The only thing still lit is the bank of elevators at
the end of the hall.
My throat hurts even more than it did when I was in the
room. The air surrounding me is hot, and rough as
sandpaper.
<Page4>
The hallway is frighteningly quiet.
Not a single sound can be heard.
There are no signs of life at all.
There are no ■■ running away.
No ■■ being burned to a crisp.
A space so tense and soundless I almost want to believe
that the scene I saw on the monitor wasn't real.
<Page5>
"There's nothing unusual here...... right?"
I walk down the hallway.
The sweat on my forehead coalesces into droplets that
roll down my face.
It's so oppressively quiet that I start to feel like
I'm trespassing.
Trespasser. Trespasser. Trespasser.
It is customary for vermin that disturb the atmosphere
of a place to be crushed.
<Page6>
"――――――"
I take another deep breath to calm myself down.
My hands are slick with sweat. I adjust my grip on the
knife, wrapping my fingers around the handle so it
won't slip.
I feel nauseous.
There's a sensation at my temple.
As though nerves are reaching out from the back of my
eyeballs toward my brain.
<Page7>
Are my eyeballs trying to sink into my brain?
Or is my brain trying to swallow my eyeballs?
Biting down on the dull pain, I continue walking along
the scorching path.
<Page8>
"――――――"
It hurts.
My eyes hurt.
My head has grown heavy, and I'm so lightheaded that I
could keel over any minute.
Yeah, I know this feeling.
It's how I always feel right before I collapse from
anemia.
<Page9>
"―――――."
It hurts.
It hurts so much I can't bear it anymore, and I take
off my glasses.
<Page10>
The elevators come into view.
It's a long hallway.
More than twenty meters remain between me and the
elevators.
They're so far away, I tell myself.
Just turn back, I tell myself.
―――Somehow.
I feel as though if I go any further, there will be no
turning back.
<Page11>
I hear a sound.
As if to disturb the peace of this immaculate, lifeless
space―――
The chime of an elevator bell rings.
<Page12>
It's so ominous that I stop in my tracks.
I can do nothing but stare at the uninvited guest.
<Page13>
The floor indicator stops moving.
The cab arrives.
I can see the lines on the elevator door in the
distance.
No, it's more like―――
The lines are so bunched up that they look like a wall
of speckles.
<Page14>
The door opens.
The small, iron box hangs agape.
<Page15>
The inside of the box...
is awash with...
the flesh of the recently deceased.
<Page16>
"――――――"
I stop breathing.
As my brain rejects my thoughts, so too do my lungs
abandon their functions.
<Page17>
An iron box. An elevator.
Tightly packed piles of red flesh.
In the midst of it all are two dogs, ravenously
gobbling up the meat.
<Page18>
Everything I can see is stained red.
Red viscous fluid begins to flow out of the elevator
with a gurgling sound.
Within that sea of blood, bodies, bones, brains,
fingers, and organs―――
The two black dogs are the only living creatures.
<Page19>
"――― ―――"
My mind refuses to accept this scene as reality.
At the end of the hallway, inside the elevator, the
dogs are scavenging off peoples' bodies.
Inside of the elevator is a vent leading to the floor
below.
Leaking through that vent are countless screams that I
couldn't hear before.
<Page20>
If I listen carefully, I can hear them.
The scratching, scraping sounds of flesh being chewed
on.
The screams calling for help, the sounds of death and
agony that barely resemble human language.
<Page21>
My brain, directly connected to my hearing, can picture
what's happening.
Although I can't see it, images form within my head.
Images of people being burned alive.
Images of people being eaten alive.
<Page22>
There was a man who had noticed the unusual
temperature. The moment he opened his door to flee, he
was engulfed by the conflagration and died.
There was a girl who had locked herself in her room,
sat down in the bath, and cried. The flames rising from
the lobby blanketed the floor, and her body was turned
to ash from the inside, like a steamed fish.
There were adults that scrambled for the elevator as
fast as they could. But the elevator was filled with
dozens of  . These guests, no longer human,
greedily set upon the adults that had just arrived.
<Page23>
Half of the screams were out of fear of being eaten,
and the other half in despair at being burned alive.
No one was spared.
Beneath my feet, inside this large box of a hotel―――
Lies a hellscape so close to me that it makes my skin
crawl.
<Page24>
"――――――"
I feel nauseous.
But I can't let myself throw up.
Because if I did that―――I would also become one with
the sea of red.
<Page25>
"―――. . . ."
I force my stalled breathing to resume.
Gritting my teeth, I regain control of myself.
<Page26>
The dogs in the elevator notice my presence.
Having come back to my senses, I realize that the noise
from downstairs has ceased.
<Page27>
"......."
In other words.
That means that there's no one left alive anymore.
<Page28>
The two black dogs break into a run.
In this hunting ground, I'm their final prey.
<Page29>
The dogs rush toward me.
I can see countless lines on their bodies.
<Page30>
But despite this―――
My paralyzed mind doesn't instruct me to fight or to
run.
<Page31>
The first of the two dogs leaps.
Its speed is incomparable to that of a human.
It took less than two seconds for it to run the length
of the twenty-meter hallway.
<Page32>
The black dog opens its mouth.
Its fangs, like rows of sawteeth, lunge for my throat.
<Page33>
Swift and precise.
At the same moment my brain finally processes that it's
coming for me―――
The dog's fangs sink into my throat with a wet squelch.
I, Tohno Shiki, have died.
<Page34>
No. That's not right.
There's no way I could be killed like this, no way I
could die like this.
I won't hesitate just because people are dead.
――――A hot summer day.
A long time ago. Seven years, to be exact.
I'm certain that back then I witnessed a much more
vividly gruesome scene than this――――
<Page35>
.
I plunge my knife into the forehead of the black dog
that had snapped at the nape of my neck.
The moment its fangs touched my skin, just before it
bit into my carotid artery, my arm moved on its own.
<Page36>
I'm amazed at myself.
I run my blade through the forehead of the dog with no
wasted motion, like a machine whose only function is to
slash and kill.
Because that was where the first dog's 'line' was.
<Page37>
Under normal circumstances, an animal won't stop moving
the instant its brain is destroyed.
Muscles that have already received signals from the
brain will execute the last given command for as long
as they are able.
<Page38>
So even if I more or less tear its head apart, the
dog's fangs will still bite my neck off.
Yeah, well―――under normal circumstances, that is.
<Page39>
However, the dog is 'dead'.
To die is to be stopped. At the moment it was about to
kill me, it lost all validity.
<Page40>
The first dog falls to the ground.
In its place, the second dog leaps for my face.
<Page41>
"――――――"
I thrust my knife into its open mouth.
With a rending sound, the blade burrows itself into the
dog's flesh. The dog's hide may be tough, but its
insides are soft. Its bones and flesh are both
literally rotten.
<Page42>
However, this was a mistake.
This thing's 'line' isn't on its face but on its chest.
By stabbing it in the mouth, all I've managed to do is
tear a hole in its flesh.
<Page43>
The knife I plunged into the roof of the dog's mouth
reaches all the way to the back of its head.
Of course, the hand holding the knife is now also
inside the dog's mouth.
<Page44>
"――――――."
The dog is still alive.
It's still able to clamp down with its jaws.
At this rate, the cartilage――the soft tissue that
connects my hand holding the knife and my arm――will
be bitten in half.
The pain finally brings me back to my senses.
<Page45>
" ―――!"
You've got to be kidding me...!
What the hell am I doing, sticking a knife in a dog's
mouth and letting it bite off my arm?!
<Page46>
"You――――little......!"
I desperately try and pull my arm out.
The pain of my arm being pulverized is so intense that
I start seeing stars.
<Page47>
The dog's fangs don't show any sign of letting go.
No, not just that―――even though I've skewered this
dog through the head, it's still brimming with energy.
<Page48>
The dog shakes its body and forcefully positions itself
on top of me.
<Page49>
"...!"
I collapse to the floor with a thud.
But I still can't get my arm out.
Even though I've run the dog through with my knife, it
continues to clamp down with its jaws.
<Page50>
" ...!"
My arm is being ripped off―――!
I can't believe it. Dogs aren't supposed to be able to
keep biting down when they're in a state like this...!
<Page51>
"Y-You, little......!"
I feel something wet and slimy.
Looking at the dog's mouth, I can see drops of blood
spilling out.
<Page52>
Is it coming from the hole I stabbed in the dog's head?
Or is this blood coming from my arm that's getting
bitten off?
To be honest, my addled mind doesn't even care which it
is.
<Page53>
"Let―――go!"
Even if I try to escape, the dog will still be latched
onto my arm.
There's no way I can escape.
There was never a way for me to escape to begin with.
I don't have a choice.
 I just want to survive. And if I
want to survive, there's only one thing I have to do.
Really, all I have to do―――is kill this thing.
<Page54>
"――――――"
So what should I do?
One of my arms will be torn off in a matter of seconds.
My knife is held by the same arm.
I'm being pushed down.
Even if I manage to pull my arm out, the black dog will
bite at my neck the very instant it gets free.
<Page55>
"―――."
In the midst of this hopeless situation, I let slip a
laugh.
Everything's going to be fine. I just have to step
back, examine the situation, and think carefully about
what to do next.
That's the teaching that's gotten you this far, right?
<Page56>
Look. There's even a whole bunch of 'lines' right there
on the back of the dog's head.
Just like that, it's always easy to see what needs to
be done to survive.
<Page57>
"――――!"
And yet, why do I hesitate?
This is a violent animal. A beast that devours humans.
But even so, right next to me――suffocatingly
close――is another living being, its pulse racing.
<Page58>
" ―――!"
The pressure bearing down on my arm grows even
stronger.
Stupid. I'm so stupid. I'm being so inconsistent that I
should just let myself be killed.
In this world, it's kill or be killed.
So then why do I―――why do humans―――
Hesitate like it's some sort of cruel act?
<Page59>
A drop of red blood falls on my face.
It slowly drips down my forehead and into my eyes.
Dark vermilion seeps into the back of my eyeballs.
<Page60>
"Ah――――"
A vermilion color that scorches my vision.
A hot, thick, nostalgic liquid.
I feel dizzy and lightheaded.
<Page61>
'Still, I...
I can't kill something that's alive.'
―――How hypocritical.
You've already killed a much greater animal than that
lowly beast.
<Page62>
Yeah... you're right.
But that time was different.
Tohno Shiki wasn't in his right mind back when he
killed Arcueid.
Even when I took down the first black dog, it had
nothing to do with my own will.
<Page63>
But this time, the decision is mine to make.
...Isn't that what Sensei said, Shiki?
That this power belongs to you alone. That it's up to
you how you use these eyes.
<Page64>
That's why―――
As long as I am who I am, as long as I continue to be a
decent human being, I should respect life and never
treat it lightly.
<Page65>
―――But that's also hypocrisy.
Because a long time ago, you already―――
<Page66>
"Ah――――――――"
A bad dream from my childhood...
<Page67>
―――Come on, what are you waiting for?
<Page68>
It was a hot summer day...
<Page69>
―――If you hadn't killed him, he'd have killed you
instead.
<Page70>
In front of me was the figure of a boy covered in
blood...
<Page71>
―――You've already
<Page72>
The hot red blood on my hands...
<Page73>
       Killed someone once before, haven't you?
<Page74>
"!"
I stab it.
Instead of pulling out my arm, I drive it even further
into the black dog's head.
<Page75>
A cry of pain echoes in my eardrums.
The black dog's cry of agony is like the high-pitched
scream of a woman. It can't howl properly because my
arm is stuck in its mouth, but it's howling all the
same.
<Page76>
I bet it must hurt a lot.
But I don't care.
I use the arm caught in the dog's jaws to thrust the
knife even deeper.
<Page77>
The knife emerges from the back of the black dog's
head.
It splits its skull and easily slices through the skin.
Sticky gobs of blood and brain tissue spray everywhere.
Incidentally, the rest of my arm also passes completely
through its head.
<Page78>
But despite all that, the black dog is still alive.
There's only one thing to do.
I reach out my other arm. I rip the knife from my
bloody fingers and grasp it firmly in my left hand.
The dog's whole body trembles in supplication.
It loosens its fangs, as if trying to apologize.
Like I care.# I simply dismantle the black dog along its
'line'.
