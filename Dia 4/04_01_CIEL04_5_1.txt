"――――――"
I still want to continue living in a proper,
respectable world.
I  feel responsible for killing Arcueid.
But that doesn't mean I think it's fair to be forced
into doing something I can't do.
<Page2>
Arcueid is asleep... I've already killed her once, and
yet she's put her trust in me and is dozing peacefully.
<Page3>
"Damn it......!"
Even so, I'm not sure I'm up to it.
I have no reason to be here, no reason to believe that
I can be of any help.
If I want to return to 'Tohno Shiki's reality', I'm not
going to get another chance.
<Page4>
The corridor is dead silent.
Arcueid rented out all of the rooms on the top floor,
so she and I are the only ones up here.
<Page5>
"―――――――"
I still feel a lingering sense of hesitation.
But I shake it off and press the button for the
elevator.
<Page6>
I catch a train from the hotel back to the city.
The time is just past noon.
Even if I head to school now, I doubt I'd make it there
in time for fifth period.
On the other hand, if I go back to the mansion, crawl
into bed, and fall asleep, I can forget about
everything.
<Page7>
"........."
For some reason, I don't feel like going back to the
mansion.
I decide to head to the park to cool my head for a bit.
<Page8>
"―――――."
A sigh escapes my lips.
I sit down on a bench and stare up at the sky in a
daze.
<Page9>
A gray sky.
The cloudy, overcast weather perfectly reflects my own
mental state.
<Page10>
I wonder if that woman is still asleep, believing in
me...
Even though I killed her, she said she forgave me.
She said she forgave me so―――what the hell am I
doing here?
<Page11>
Last night...
I acknowledged my mistake in Senpai's room and vowed to
make amends in my own way.
Is that a vow I could break if my life were in danger,
I wonder?
<Page12>
"........."
But, I don't want to just throw my life away.
This is a problem that I will struggle with for as long
as I live. It's not something that can be resolved by a
moment of contrition.
<Page13>
'―――That power belongs to you alone.
But that's the reason why you must never forget.'
<Page14>
"――――"
I recall some very important words someone said to me
long ago.
What words did that person... did Sensei leave me with
again?
<Page15>
"......"
I can still make it.
The sun has not yet set.
If I return to the hotel before the sun goes down, I
can still start over.
<Page16>
"Damn―――――it."
I can't shake off my doubts.
In end, I――――
C:> I think I'll go back to the mansion.
C:> I think I'll go back to the hotel.
