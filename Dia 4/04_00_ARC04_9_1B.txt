"――――――"
I look down at what used to be a living thing.
I remove the dog's jaw from around my arm with ease.
"―――――――What the hell. It barely bit into me at
all."
<Page2>
I look at my bloody arm.
There are bite marks on my school uniform, but the
marks gouged into my flesh are no more than a
centimeter deep.
<Page3>
The majority of the blood belongs to the black dog
whose head I had pierced.
The pain I felt when it bit me had been minor, but my
fear had made it seem many times worse than it was.
<Page4>
"――――――."
I lie down on the ground and look up at the ceiling.
My head hurts.
The world has started to fray at the edges, and I can
see the lines of death poking through here and there.
The warmth has completely faded from my limbs, but my
mind is still feverishly turning over.
<Page5>
"――― ."
Right next to me are the corpses of the two black dogs.
One of my arms is smeared with blood, and the other is
clutching a red knife.
In addition... there are countless human corpses
littering the lower floors.
<Page6>
I can't help but laugh.
Because none of this is real.
There's no way any of this could be real.
Therefore I must be normal.
I'm completely, absolutely, normal.
The only crazy thing here is this dream I'm having. As
soon as I wake up, it'll all be over.
<Page7>
Ah, but―――how long have I been dreaming with my eyes
wide open like this―――?
