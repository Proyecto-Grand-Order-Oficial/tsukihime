――――My life has been unfortunate.
I remember the scene from yesterday when I killed
Arcueid.
<Page2>
A time filled with the stench of blood and death.
I don't want to go through something like that ever
again.
But if I stay with Arcueid, it's inevitable that I
will. If I want to avoid that, I have no choice but to
go back to the mansion.
<Page3>
"――――――"
There's a glaring flaw with that choice, though...
Choosing that path would mean turning a blind eye to
the knowledge that what I'm doing is morally
reprehensible.
I am not running away.
I tell myself that I'm just returning to the way things
were.
<Page4>
"I'll go back to the mansion... If I do that, then
surely..."
By the time dawn breaks I'm sure that out there, in a
place that's no longer any of my concern, some sort of
conclusion will have been reached.
<Page5>
"Hey you. Do you have a second?"
"Huh?"
Just as I'm about to get up from the bench, someone
calls out to me from behind.
<Page6>
"I was planning on just ignoring you, but you had such
an incredibly pathetic look on your face."
<Page7>
There's a girl standing there. I feel like I may have
seen her somewhere before, but I can't be sure.
She seems to be a middle school student, but she isn't
wearing a uniform. I wonder if she's also skipping
school.
<Page8>
"Pathetic...? What is?"
"Your face. It has the same color as clay. People start
looking like that when they die, don't they?"
<Page9>
"――――――"
Even as a joke, that's in poor taste.
I can't laugh off what she just said.
The girl is staring at me, not seeming to care that
I've taken it so seriously.
<Page10>
"I'm not joking, I'm speaking based on experience. The
grandpa of someone I know stopped breathing three hours
after his face started looking like that. Maybe if I'd
called an ambulance, they could have saved him."
<Page11>
The girl doesn't approach me.
She keeps her distance, staying about a meter away.
<Page12>
"Do you want me to call an ambulance?
If you do, lend me your phone. I don't want to use mine
for this."
<Page13>
"―――#."
I let out a sigh of relief at the unexpected offer.
Just as the girl says, it seems that I'd sunk into a
malaise without noticing.
<Page14>
I snap back to the real world and my breathing returns
to normal.
<Page15>
"No, I'm fine. It's just some mild anemia, it'll pass
soon.
―――But even so, thanks for calling out to me. That
was a real help."
<Page16>
"I see. I'll leave you to it then.
Your health... has it always been this bad?"
"Hm?"
Right as she's about to say goodbye, the girl asks me a
strange question.
<Page17>
"Well... I guess you could say I was born with it?
Ever since I was a kid, even light exercise has been
enough to make me dizzy."
"Hmm. I guess dogs are out of the question then. You
can't play with them after all."
"No, just going for a walk isn't really a problem."
I don't have any desire to get a dog, but it's kind of
sad to completely deny the possibility.
<Page18>
"A walk...
Your face is still pale. I suggest that you hurry home
and get some rest."
<Page19>
The girl walks away.
"Huh...?"
As she left, I somehow got the feeling that her
physical condition was far more dire than my own.
<Page20>
I ended up resting in the park for a while before
heading home.
When the sun set, it became pitch black outside.
<Page21>
It's after seven in the evening.
Curfew at the mansion is eight o'clock, so I'd better
get a move on if I don't want Akiha to give me a hard
time again.
<Page22>
The streets around the mansion are as empty as ever.
Even though the sun has only just set, it's as quiet as
if it were the dead of night.
<Page23>
"Speaking of which, this place is..."
I'm pretty sure this is the spot where I came to
investigate what all the howling was about the night I
came back to the mansion.
<Page24>
"Huh?"
Just now, something resembling a black lump of
meat―――
<Page25>
"――――――"
My consciousness freezes.
Why are those here, I wonder.
It's obvious, I realize.
<Page26>
Arcueid wasn't the only one they spotted back in that
alleyway.
Of course the human that was with her would become a
wanted man as well.
Didn't I turn a blind eye so that I wouldn't be aware
of that fact?
<Page27>
I whip out my knife, as though trying to make up for
lost time.
I back away, keeping my eyes trained on the corpses
emerging from the thicket by the side of the road.
At that moment―――
<Page28>
――――That's strange.
Everywhere I look, my surroundings have suddenly been
painted a bright red.
<Page29>
I hear a rumbling sound.
It's coming from somewhere very close.
My entire body leaps in pain like a released spring.
I'm thrashing and flailing all over the place.
My consciousness, my body, my vision, the world―――
They're all spinning around and around like an
emergency beacon.
<Page30>
. . .
The sound.
Somehow, it seems to be coming from my own body.
<Page31>
"■■■■■―――!"
I fall to the asphalt.
I can't move my arms or legs. There's nothing left to
move.
My eyes see nothing but pain.
<Page32>
"―――A lack of warmth.
You weren't even a dog that could protect its own
master."
<Page33>
I hear a hoarse voice.
The sound of grease bursting out onto the asphalt.
Only at the very end did Tohno Shiki realize it to be
the remains of the filth that had poured out of him.
