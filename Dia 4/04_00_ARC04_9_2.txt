I'll stay in the room and see what happens.
With Arcueid unable to move, it would be suicide to
venture outside of this room without a plan.
<Page2>
"........."
Time continues to tick away...
With my knife clutched in one hand, I stare at the
monitor that now shows nothing but flames.
<Page3>
Arcueid's eyes are closed.
Seeing her, I'm reminded of how beautiful―――no, how
 she looked under the moonlight earlier.
More than half a day has passed since the incident in
the alleyway.
She must have regained at least some of her strength by
now.
<Page4>
...
.........
...............It's hot.
It's as though someone's lit a fire right in front of
me, and I'm being smoked like a piece of meat.
<Page5>
It's getting hard to breathe.
I thought I'd be safe as long as I stayed in this room,
but at this rate, I'll die before anything even
happens.
<Page6>
"......"
I wonder... should I go outside, even knowing the
risks?
There's still some time left.
Just as I'm reconsidering my decision―――
<Page7>
The lights go out.
The freakishly high temperature also returns to normal.
At the same time―――
I hear something banging furiously against the door.
<Page8>
"Shiki, are you ready?"
Just four words.
Arcueid whispers to me in the dark.
"Ready... for what...?"
There was no need for me to even ask.
<Page9>
If staying in this room was a mistake―――
Then was it also a mistake to ask that question?
<Page10>
I hear the sound of the door being broken down, and
whirl around to face it.
<Page11>
"――――!"
A moment of impatience―――
Coupled with the fact I'd stepped away from the door as
a safety precaution―――
Has ultimately led to this being the 'result'.
<Page12>
Two dogs have broken down the door and burst into the
room.
Immediately after they're flung away by Arcueid's
claws―――
An inescapable quantity of fire floods into the room,
completely filling it from floor to ceiling.
<Page13>
"――――― ―――――――――――――"
Fire won't instantly kill a person unless it's burning
exceptionally hot. But this flame is like a blunt
instrument that can reduce a human body to ashes with a
single blow.
<Page14>
It reminds me of the mechanics of a flamethrower.
Although it looks like it's shooting flames, in
reality, it is hurling fuel at its target, so more
literally it's a 'firestarter'.
<Page15>
This fire probably works on a similar principle.
Anything touched by that whip of flame will dissolve
into ash.
<Page16>
There's no way the human body can withstand something
that so easily incinerated tables and walls.
The only good thing about it is that it's so powerful
that my upper body is blown away in an instant, sparing
me the pain of being burned to death by the flames.
