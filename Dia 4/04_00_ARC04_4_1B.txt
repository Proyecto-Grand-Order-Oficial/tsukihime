<Page1>
"I'll―――"
Struggling with how to reply, I raise my head.
<Page2>
"...?"
In that instant―――my gaze meets another pair of
eyes.
<Page3>
"―――!"
My slackened consciousness tightens.
As strength returns to my worn-out legs, I shift my
body from a sitting position to a crouch.
<Page4>
Following my gaze, the woman also looks back at the
entrance to the alleyway.
Over there―――
Is something even more outlandish than the woman who
calls herself a vampire. A creature that should not
exist in a human city.
<Page5>
"――――――"
The woman looks on unconcerned, but I just can't grasp
what's going on here.
<Page6>
That's a panther. I can tell that much. It's an animal
even a child would recognize.
Except normally, you'd only see one in a cage or a
picture book.
I'm experiencing firsthand how terrifying it is to face
one without any walls separating us.
<Page7>
Thin, strong limbs.
Muscles as supple as rubber, but as strong as steel.
This creature is vastly different from a human being; a
form that has been tailored to the task of 'hunting
prey' and nothing else.
<Page8>
Ancestral memories that should have been long forgotten
creep back into my mind.
As a fellow creature, I stop breathing in awe and fear
of its superior athletic ability.
It goes without saying that there's no way I can
coexist with this creature, let alone come to an
understanding with it.
<Page9>
The black panther is over a meter long.
Even a dog could easily take down a human if it were
that size.
Armed with vicious fangs and claws, the panther is
staring at me and the woman in white from no more than
five meters away.
<Page10>
"Hey. Is that someone you know?"
"Of course not!"
I couldn't help but snap back at her stupid comment.
<Page11>
―――I really am an idiot.
With my voice as a signal, the panther leaps.
Or rather, it runs. It's just so fast that my brain
couldn't even understand that it wasn't leaping.
<Page12>
"――――――"
There's nothing I can do.
The black panther sinks its fangs into my shoulder
before I've even finished processing its initial
movement.
<Page13>
Even though I could see it coming.
Even though I knew what was about to happen, I couldn't
avoid it. I didn't even get a chance to  about
avoiding it.
<Page14>
"―――――?"
Except, the impact I feel is on my side.
Before the black shadow is able to take a bite out of
me, I'm flung away by the woman in white.
<Page15>
She does it with one hand like it's nothing.
As soon as her hand touches my side, I'm sent flying
toward the wall as though she'd thrown me like a ball.
<Page16>
"...!"
I endure the pain of having my back slammed into the
wall.
<Page17>
"What're you―――?"
"Never mind that, look in front of you!"
<Page18>
The woman shouts.
Looking over, I see that even though it missed me, the
panther didn't crash into the wall. Instead it abruptly
pivoted, planted all four paws on the wall, and leapt
across to the wall on the other side.
<Page19>
The black mass clings to the side of the building.
Just as I think the panther has come to a stop on the
wall, it once again turns its gleaming eyes on me―――
<Page20>
"――――――"
I gasp at the split-second exchange.
The panther leaps off the wall as fast as a bolt of
lightning.
Jumping to get in its line of fire, the woman in white
flicks the lightning away with one hand.
<Page21>
What's frightening is... her leap looked so effortless.
The fact that she moved even faster than that black
panther, yet still made it seem easy really rubs me the
wrong way.
<Page22>
"Hey, I got to him first, okay?
If you don't back off, I'll really kill you."
<Page23>
Her attitude hasn't changed one bit.
The panther growls menacingly, but keeps a careful
distance from the woman.
The distance between them is about three meters.
The panther doesn't make any attempt to close the gap.
It must understand the difference in ability between
the two of them.
<Page24>
That panther is indeed a monster. A monster to humans.
Any human that's unlucky enough to cross paths with it
is doomed to die.
But... that woman is on another level. She's a monster
 . Any monster that comes face to face with
her has no choice but to accept its death.
<Page25>
The panther motionlessly observes the woman.
Even I can grasp the difference in power between them.
From the perspective of a wild predator, it must be
like suddenly running up against a massive wall.
<Page26>
"I'll hear you out later, so don't get in my way―――#"
The woman's attitude changes.
Her expression, which hadn't changed even when she was
confronted by that black beast, becomes noticeably more
alert.
<Page27>
"P-People...!?"
As best I can tell, they're just passersby.
They slowly make their way through the dark passages in
between the buildings and out into the alleyway.
<Page28>
"No, don't come any closer! There's a panther―――"
I was about to say 'There's a panther here'―――
When a red numbness flashes across my eyeballs.
<Page29>
"――――――"
I reach under my glasses and rub my eyes.
Just now―――
I could have sworn I saw something atrocious.
<Page30>
They don't stop.
They have neither the feral instincts, nor the pride of
the panther.
They continue to shuffle forward, indifferent to what
the woman in white in front of them is, even though
they know they'll be torn to shreds if they take even
just a few more steps.
<Page31>
After all, there are no brains inside these things.
They don't have hearts that can feel fear.
You couldn't even say that these things are really
alive.
<Page32>
They're burning. Black smoke is billowing out of their
eyes and mouths. And yet, they move.
<Page33>
They're dead.
Those are dead people.
Their hands, outstretched as though seeking salvation,
spill forth with waste oil.
As soon as the spilled oil hits the road, it extends a
tongue of flame.
Even at a distance, I can understand that fluid is
stagnant blood.
<Page34>
"What is this, a new species...?"
The woman in white is completely transfixed by those
things.
Of the three corpses, two reach out for her.
As I stand there dumbfounded, the other one, shaking
violently, turns its head toward me, flames spilling
from its eye sockets―――
<Page35>
I'm done for.
The black beast isn't going to let this opportunity to
go in for the kill go to waste.
<Page36>
"...!"
Its charge is even faster than the leap it made
earlier.
This time, I can't even perceive it.
<Page37>
The panther bowls into me and locks its fangs around my
neck.
<Page38>
"...?"
My neck feels tight.
It feels like it's pressed against the back of my neck.
Wait, is it latched onto the collar of my school
uniform...!?
<Page39>
"!"
I'm thrown up against a wall yet again.
It's another corner of the back alley. The panther
drags me here like I'm a sack of garbage.
<Page40>
"Y-You, stop treating people like they're
garbage―――!"
What am I doing...?
I can't believe I'm complaining to the panther that
dragged me here.
<Page41>
Fortunately, the panther doesn't stick around. Most
likely it doesn't have the time to care about me.
<Page42>
Hiding behind some scrap wood, I straighten myself up
and look over at the woman.
The smoldering corpses have finally reached the line
the panther never dared cross, three meters from the
woman in white.
In an instant―――
<Page43>
I could have sworn the atmosphere itself let out a
scream.
The airflow generated by the movement of the woman's
arms is like the shovel of a bulldozer, obliterating
the three walking corpses without a trace.
