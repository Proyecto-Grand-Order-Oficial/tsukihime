The night is drawing to a close.
Arcueid is perched on the edge of the bed.
Meanwhile, I'm sitting on the sofa, zoning out as I
stare at the clock.
<Page2>
The time is a little after four in the morning.
There's only about an hour left before dawn.
<Page3>
"One more hour, huh?"
Nothing unusual has happened so far, and Arcueid
herself shows no signs of being nervous.
The hotel is peaceful to a fault.
<Page4>
I was honestly a little on edge because of how quiet
everything was, but in the end, it seems as though I
was worried over nothing.
I'm not sure why, but I get the feeling that tonight
will continue to slip away uneventfully.
<Page5>
"Hey, Shiki."
Arcueid calls out to me for the umpteenth time.
<Page6>
"What do you want? I'm already out of things to talk
about."
"Really? We've come all the way here, it feels like a
waste to just sit around and do nothing."
<Page7>
"Arcueid... How long do you think we've been talking
for at this point?
It's been six hours. . If you were to ask me what's
more tiring, talking with you easily beats out standing
guard."
<Page8>
Arcueid glares at me with displeasure.
That's right.
For whatever reason, she keeps trying to start up a
conversation.
<Page9>
I told her that if she's feeling weak she's better off
going to sleep, but―――
"It's much more fun to talk."
She just won't listen to me, so we've wound up being
conversation partners instead.
<Page10>
"......"
I really don't understand what goes through her head.
To make matters worse, my stomach is growling.
Come to think of it, I haven't eaten in close to
twenty-four hours―――the last meal I had was
breakfast yesterday.
<Page11>
"If you're hungry, why don't you eat something?
We went out of our way to stay at a hotel, so why not
order some room service?"
<Page12>
"I'll pass, it'd ruin the mood if I ate something.
Also, you're one to talk. You're the one who's weak
right now, and even if you refuse to sleep, you should
at least eat."
<Page13>
"If you aren't going to eat, then neither will I.
Sure, there'd be some benefit in eating a normal meal,
but it'd be boring to be eating alone."
<Page14>
"A normal meal? I don't think meals are particularly
normal or special―――"
Oh... right.
She doesn't look it at all, but Arcueid is supposedly a
vampire.
If she is, then sucking human blood would be her way of
having a 'meal'.
<Page15>
Arcueid said earlier that vampires need human blood in
order to survive.
If that's true―――whose blood has this woman sucked
before, and consequently, how many humans has she
killed?
<Page16>
"――――"
I steal a glance at Arcueid's face.
This is ridiculous...
Even though she's explained to me numerous times that
she's a vampire, I just can't imagine her sucking
someone's blood―――
<Page17>
"What? Is there something on my face?"
"...!"
Panicking, I look away.
Arcueid stares intently at my face for a second,
 and
then flashes a devious grin in my direction.
<Page18>
"You're curious, right?"
"A-About what?"
"About how many people I've sucked blood from in the
past. Do you want to know?"
"..."
<Page19>
She saw right through me...
Arcueid is grinning so broadly that it's starting to
make me a little uncomfortable.
I don't like where this is going―――but even so, I
can't help but wonder how many people this woman has
killed.
<Page20>
"I mean... yeah, I'm curious. I'm working with you
after all.
If I don't even know that, how am I supposed to predict
when you're going to have a change of heart and attack
me?"
<Page21>
That's what's really bugging me.
Arcueid seems to have understood what I'm saying.
<Page22>
"In that case, here's a question.
How many people do you think I've sucked blood from so
far?"
<Page23>
Arcueid springs off the bed, lands on the floor with a
soft thud, and walks over to the window.
<Page24>
"How many? That's―――"
Arcueid smirks. It seems she's enjoying watching me
struggle to come up with an answer.
It's obvious that she's trying to provoke me.
<Page25>
Fine... I'll give her a straight answer.
We're talking about this weirdo here, so I'm sure that
number is―――
C:> Ten people...?
C:> One hundred...?
C:> One thousand...?
