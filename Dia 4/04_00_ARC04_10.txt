.
A cheerful sound rings out, terribly out-of-place.
"Ele... vator...?"
Another elevator arrives right next to the one from
earlier.
My exhausted brain cannot process what this means.
<Page2>
The door opens.
Even though my brain isn't functioning properly, my
body automatically stands up and shifts the knife back
to my right hand, ready to face the tragedy that is
about to unfold.
<Page3>
Ah... I don't like this at all.
The second iron box swings open.
Inside it is―――
<Page4>
"――――――Nothing?"
There's nothing inside.
<Page5>
This feels like a bit of an anticlimax...
The danger has passed.
Everything may be already over, but at least now I know
what happened on the lower floors.
Since there's no longer any reason to be here, I turn
to go back when―――
<Page6>
" , any, one, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone!"
A comically absurd female voice rings out.
Her voice, along with her footsteps, grows louder and
louder.
<Page7>
There's no doubt about it.
A survivor is breathlessly running up the stairs next
to the elevators...!
<Page8>
"  ... Oh thank goodness, this floor isn't on
fire...!"
I can hear her cries of joy.
The sound of her footsteps doesn't stop.
The source of the voice tumbles onto the landing by the
elevators.
<Page9>
"You! Hey, you over there!"
Noticing my presence in the hallway, the woman begins
to run once again.
<Page10>
"Thank goodness, I'm saved...! I'm finally saved...!"
Her face that had been tense with fear begins to
radiate joy.
<Page11>
"Huh...?"
A pallid hand appears and drags that hope back into the
depths of hell.
"No way... no, no, NOOOOO!"
She continues to stare at me, begging for help.
<Page12>
She doesn't mount any resistance at all.
The woman is restrained with ease.
The instant she's grabbed by his hand, she loses
consciousness as though suddenly waking from a dream.
<Page13>
―――Stop.
―――Stop right there.
―――That woman.
―――She has nothing to do with us,# she's just an
innocent woman.
―――Don't feed on her, at the very least.
<Page14>
"Sto―――!"
My plea doesn't make it in time.
Even if it had, it wouldn't have made a difference.
<Page15>
I stare at the woman's neck.
It feels as though stars are streaking across my eyes.
Unprecedented rage sharpens my vision.
Two bottomless eyes cloaked with bloody resentment.
<Page16>
The woman's limbs twitch softly.
"...  ―――"
All emotion and vitality drains from her face, stolen
away by that man.
<Page17>
I've never seen anything like this before.
Yet despite only now seeing it for the first time, I
don't need an explanation to know what's taking place.
<Page18>
I can even hear the sound of him gulping it down.
After a long period of feasting, the man casually
discards her body.
The woman falters like a withered tree.
A ballerina dancing on the precipice above the abyss of
death.
On her wretched back―――
<Page19>
There are no screams.
Only the sound of bloodshed echoes through the air.
Her ruptured back.
A shower of blood.
The vampire lets out a sigh of relief as he bathes in
it.
<Page20>
The world changes drastically.
The apparent temperature finally matches that of
reality.
A layer of flame envelops the corridor.
Like a river overtopping a dam.
<Page21>
The heat scorches my skin.
If I breathe now, my lungs will fry for sure.
<Page22>
But... something's off.
They're burning. The flames are definitely flickering.
And yet, the  isn't being burned.
The only one affected by these flames is me―――a
living creature.
<Page23>
I can feel a headache coming on.
The man starts walking toward me.
He is the source of this river of flames.
The closer he gets, the hotter the atmosphere becomes.
<Page24>
He's still fifteen meters away.
He isn't even that close, but I'm already unable to
breathe.
In other words, any living thing would be annihilated
if they so much as approached this man.
<Page25>
The slim figure advances toward me.
His outfit is eccentric. Elegant, traditional-style
clothing cloaked in a barbarian overcoat.
He may resemble a human, but it's clear this man is
anything but.
Everything is out of sync. I'm about to go crazy.
Thirteen meters.
He strides toward me in complete silence.
<Page26>
"―――"
I ready my knife and glare at the man.
No response. I wonder if he can even see me.
Ten meters.
I fix my eyes on him.
Within the midst of the roiling flames, his lines of
death come into view.
<Page27>
"―――"
The contents of my skull boil like soup.
<Page28>
What the hell is ?
An intricate, swirling, dense torrent of death.
It shines conspicuously at his core, like a jewel―――
<Page29>
"...!"
My headache becomes too much to bear, and I tear my
eyes away.
That thing is bad news. I shouldn't stare at that point
at the man's core.
It's like how if you look directly at the sun, you'll
burn your retinas.
My brain will explode if I look at that  without
preparing myself first.
<Page30>
Eight meters.
The distance between us continues to shrink.
The temperature is rising. But it's still not hot
enough to burn my flesh.
<Page31>
Six meters.
The man stops there.
His gaze focuses on me. Having come this close, the man
finally notices I'm here.
<Page32>
―――Our eyes meet.
       .
The woman in white's warning flashes across my mind.
But I can't take my eyes off him.
I cannot ignore the bottomless voids in front of me.
<Page33>
His eyes are different. They must be fundamentally
different to the Mystic Eyes that the woman in white
was talking about. These eyes don't have the power to
paralyze at all. Because these are eyes of madness. The
eyes of a madman. An ugly and ungainly being that's
driven by nothing but his impulses, cast about on the
waves of his own abnormality.
A bastard just like me―――
<Page34>
"...!"
My instincts tell me I'm in danger.
Alarm bells ring inside my head.
But my body still won't move. Not even a single
fingertip responds.
<Page35>
Danger signals ricochet around my skull.
No matter what means or methods I use, I must get away
from here immediately, or else my life will come to an
end.
<Page36>
―――But it's already too late.
The sickly-eyed man, without even acknowledging my
existence―――
Burns me to death with his 'hand'.
<Page37>
"――――"
I'm dead.
After all, these flames are the real deal.
The blue flames that drench the hallway are nothing
more than an effect that manifests outside of reality.
Even if I were swallowed by them, it wouldn't be enough
to kill me outright. They must be some kind of phantom
pain that only affects living beings.
<Page38>
But this is different.
These flames are real. Simply getting close to them
would be enough to burn my skin. Anything living would
be turned to ash from a single touch.
Sharp claws of flame lash out at me.
<Page39>
My body will be cut in two at the waist, and burn up as
the fire spreads from that cross section.
An outcome even more obvious than the fire itself.
And yet, just before the flames connect―――
<Page40>
A thud reverberates down the hallway, and my body is
yanked backwards.
<Page41>
"―――Arcueid...?"
A sound of utter disbelief escapes my throat.
My thoughts go blank.
<Page42>
I understand what happened.
Arcueid pulled me back, and as she did so, stepped in
front of me to take the brunt of that 'hand'.
<Page43>
But her actions make no sense to me whatsoever.
 the one who's supposed be acting as a shield here.
So why is she hurting herself in order to protect
me...?
<Page44>
"――――!"
Arcueid's face twists in agony.
<Page45>
The flaming hands reach out again and again.
She doesn't need to pull me back this time.
Arcueid swings her right hand and blows away the
flames, just as she did in the alleyway.
<Page46>
But even that isn't perfect.
The flames aren't fully extinguished, and the dregs
scorch her skin.
You're telling me... that even a person like Arcueid
can get burned by a direct hit...?
<Page47>
Are these flames hot enough that they'd prove fatal
even to her, the woman furthest away from death...!?
<Page48>
It all happened in under five seconds.
Ten shots were fired, and ten shots were intercepted.
For whatever reason, the man solemnly lowers his arm.
<Page49>
"......"
He stares at Arcueid in silence.
She glares back at the man in pain, her stomach dyed a
deep red.
<Page50>
The man is only paying attention to Arcueid.
He's acting as though the knife-wielding guy behind her
isn't even there.
<Page51>
"........."
Steam pours from his mouth.
After expelling a breath like exhaust from an engine,
the man reaches under his coat with his left hand.
<Page52>
I hear a faint metallic clink.
There's no mistaking it. That was the sound of a blade.
There's a long object hidden under that coat. It must
be the same thing he used to slash the woman in front
of the elevator.
<Page53>
The man begins to move.
With the blade still hidden under his coat, he goes to
take a step toward Arcueid.
<Page54>
"        

"
"――――――"
<Page55>
The man's legs stop in their tracks.
A flicker of ego stirs in his ghostly eyes.
Arcueid's words were in a language I couldn't make
heads or tails of, but the man lets out a guttural
sound in response.
His voice sounds pained, as if he had forgotten that he
was a living creature until now.
<Page56>
"...I know the formalities.
But, as of yet, I have no name to share with the likes
of you."
<Page57>
"You may not have any manners, but it seems that you
can feel some shame at least.
So you have lost your original name, huh... but you do
have something to be called by, do you not? You may
have only recently succeeded to your role, but you
still number among the Ancestors."
<Page58>
The atmosphere changes.
The intensity of the blue flames burning in the hallway
skyrockets.
Did Arcueid's words strike some nerve in the man?
<Page59>
"―――Vlov."
A troubled expression on his face, the flame-spreading
vampire speaks―――
"Vlov Arkhangel."
And in doing so, reveals his name.
<Page60>
"An unfamiliar name. Since I have no record of you, I
doubt you're a legitimate Successor. Could it be that
your sire died by their own hand?"
"Incorrect... My liege... I killed her."
<Page61>
"So you just recently became an Ancestor, then.
And now you intend to raise your prestige by killing
me?"
"Honor... is something that exists within one's own
breast.
I... will take away nothing but the things I desire."
<Page62>
"As admirable as your determination may be, you should
have focused that desire on me alone.
This is a bit over the top."
"No... This city is rotten to the core.
If I do not burn it to the ground, it would go against
everything that I believe in."
"Oh really. In other words, you're just like all those
other third-rate Dead Apostles then."
<Page63>
"I am well aware of my crude nature...
Princess of the True Ancestors. That heart of yours,
shall be mine."
<Page64>
"...!"
The space around the vampire that calls himself Vlov
warps.
The river of flame that pours out from around him grows
even larger.
Arcueid's body acts as a breakwater, preventing me from
being swallowed by the raging torrent.
<Page65>
"Don't move, Shiki. That flame is his weapon.
If you don't want to be turned to ash, then stay behind
me."
<Page66>
As much as I appreciate her advice, I can't help but
feel a sense of unease that can't be put into words.
 his weapon? Really?
Because if he's created an environment as superheated
as this one, it's almost as if his true form is
actually―――
<Page67>
No, now is not the time to think.
I focus my attention and grasp the knife.
<Page68>
―――It's coming.
The hallway has already become a cave of fire.
Just as Vlov is about to unleash the blade from under
his coat―――
<Page69>
"Huh...?"
―――This happens.
The man turns his back on us all of a sudden.
<Page70>
He walks over to the elevators as if nothing had
happened, boards one with the same air of composure,
and leaves the floor.
<Page71>
"Wha―――"
I don't understand what's going on at all anymore...!
Not the two dogs that attacked me, not the flames that
covered the corridor, and not the nightmarish reality
that descended on this hotel!
<Page72>
"Shi―――ki."
Arcueid collapses against me with a thud.
It's a nasty wound... The bleeding from her stomach has
stopped, but her face is contorted in pain.
<Page73>
―――It happened just a few seconds ago.
She got that wound protecting me from that man.
<Page74>
"That's right... why, did you...?"
<Page75>
"Yeah... I underestimated him a bit.
I thought I could save you and still dodge the attack
in that situation, but#―――
as expected of you, Shiki.
Those wounds that you inflicted on me were worse than I
thought."
<Page76>
With her face still contorted in pain, Arcueid cracks a
smile at her own joke.
<Page77>
"――――――"
I can't look at her.
She got that wound protecting me. On top of that, she
wouldn't even have been in harm's way if it weren't for
me in the first place―――I don't know how I'm
supposed to respond when she looks at me with that
idiotic smile on her face.
<Page78>
Arcueid leans her body against mine and gently closes
her eyes.
<Page79>
"Wait a minute, what are you closing your eyes for, you
idiot!
Get a hold of yourself. You're supposed to be an
invincible vampire at night, aren't you!?"
<Page80>
"Yeah... but... it seems... that I'm at my limit."
"Wha――――"
"I'm sorry, but I need you to take me back to my
apartment."
<Page81>
Arcueid collapses on me.
I feel the weight of her body as I catch her in my
arms.
"―――Wait a minute, you can't be―――"
If you die on me right now, I  won't know how to
respond...!
<Page82>
"No, you can't. Wake up, Arcueid...!"
I call out to her as she lies there with her eyes
softly shut.
And then.
"..."
Her somnolent breathing sounds so happy it makes me
feel like an idiot for yelling a second ago.
<Page83>
"......"
All my worries melt away.
It seems that Arcueid is just asleep.
<Page84>
"... Telling me to take you home, just how selfish
can you get―――"
But given the circumstances, I'll let it slide.
And besides, it's not a good idea to stick around this
hotel any longer.
<Page85>
This was an incredible tragedy...
Even if nobody outside could see all of the bizarre
events that transpired here, sooner or later someone's
going to notice.
<Page86>
"..."
My headache won't let up.
My body is also at its limit.
I put on my glasses so that I can at least rid myself
of my headache.
<Page87>
"Arcueid's apartment... Ah, she must mean that place."
<Page88>
I've only been there once, but I definitely remember
it.
There's no point in staying here.
I retrieve my luggage from the royal suite, and with
Arcueid in my arms, shamefully leave the now vacant
hotel.
<Page89>
The sky outside is bright.
"I see... so that's what happened."
<Page90>
The reason why the man left was so simple.
The sun had already fully risen over the city.
Without me even noticing, night had given way to day.
<Page91>
First things first, I should let Arcueid get some rest.
I decide not to catch a cab.
A suspicious pair like us are bound to be remembered.
<Page92>
Trying to put as much distance as possible between us
and the hotel, I board a bus headed for Souya Station.
Fortunately, it's early in the morning so we don't
attract any attention.
<Page93>
The emergency exit at the back of the building is still
the same as it was the day before yesterday.
The residents and managers must not have noticed that
the lock has been 'cut'.
<Page94>
6:30 AM.
Once again, I creep into the room of the
self-proclaimed vampire woman. I have a feeling that
this long day has come to an end at last.
