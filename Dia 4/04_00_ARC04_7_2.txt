How suspicious...
Her specifying that she's not going to break them feels

"Even if all you're going to do is look, that's a no.
I got a glimpse of your insane brute strength when we
were in that back alley. I can't risk the chance that
you end up crushing them with your bare hands."
<Page3>
"What do you mean 'insane brute strength'? It was only
natural to use that amount of force given the
situation.
Besides, your power would be higher than mine under
normal circumstances, and it's not as though I go
around breaking things indiscriminately."

As Arcueid says that, she reaches out her hand as
though to take off my glasses. Her behavior is only
getting more and more suspicious.
<Page5>

"Ah, he ran away."
"You bet I'm running away. I may be getting used to
your recklessness, but there's no way I'm handing over

It seems she's just curious about things that people
hold dear. What is she, a child?
<Page8>
"Alright, you got me, I'm stingy. Humans can't come
back to life, so I'm cautious about everything.
Besides... if I lose these glasses, you can basically
say goodbye to us working together. Who knows what
would happen to my mind if I had a constant headache
from seeing those lines all the time."
