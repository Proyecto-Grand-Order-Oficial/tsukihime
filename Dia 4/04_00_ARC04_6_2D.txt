<Page1>
"Well, I guess it's my turn now.
To tell you the truth, I forgot to ask you something
important too."
"Huh? I don't get it, what could you possibly have to
ask me about? I'm not a vampire or anything crazy like
that, I'm just a student."
<Page2>
"Hmm. Then let me ask you something, Shiki.
How on earth did you kill me?"
"What?"
<Page3>
"I'm asking you what kind of method you used to kill
me.
My antibodies can render secret arts like Runes and
Kabbalah useless, but they couldn't mount any
resistance whatsoever against whatever  you
used. If we're talking about magecraft I haven't
experienced before, it would have to be either the
ancient Shintoism of this country or the hidden
treasures of South America."
<Page4>
"No... neither of those would have been able to 'kill'
me so thoroughly.
Answer me, Shiki. What kind of arcane antique did you
use to incapacitate me?"
<Page5>
"Hold on, what the heck is an 'arcane antique'?"
I can tell that Arcueid is being serious.
But I don't understand a single thing she's just said.
<Page6>
"I'm obviously talking about  .
Catalysts comprised of history and ideas.
Even this country has some sacred artifacts, right? I
think they're mostly Buddhist staves, swords, or jewels
and masks used as   though.
Hey, Shiki―――are you  you're not involved with
that sort of thing?"
<Page7>
"Absolutely not. Like I said, I'm just an ordinary
student. I have literally no clue what any of that is."
<Page8>
"You're lying! There's no way that a human who isn't
even a mage would be able to hurt me.
Shiki... there's something you're not telling me, isn't
there?"
<Page9>
Arcueid glares at me like an angry cat.
She can glare at me all she wants, but it's not like
I'm hiding anything―――
Wait... there is something.
<Page10>
"Sorry. To tell you the truth, there is one thing.
But... I'm not sure if it's relevant here."
<Page11>
Arcueid continues to glower at me.
She isn't going to back down unless I tell her
everything.
<Page12>
"How do I put this... I can see lines along which
things can be cut."
"Lines that can be cut?"
That's about the reaction I'd expect. Who'd believe
something like that?
In fact, I don't think a single person I've told ever
has.
<Page13>
"What do you mean by that?"
However, Arcueid's reply seems completely serious.
<Page14>
"I told you, I can see the lines along which things can
be cut.
It doesn't matter if it's a living thing, the surface
of the earth, or anything in between―――if I can
touch it, then I can cut it. It's a bit like a crack,
in that if I run a blade along it then I can easily
split the thing in two... am I making any sense?"
<Page15>
"It's pretty convenient to be able to cut steel with
nothing more than a knife, but it's not like I can cut
things however I want. I can only cut along the lines
that are already there, so it wouldn't be much use for
DIY or anything like that.
And the time I cut you... well, it makes sense that I'd
be able to pierce a woman's skin with a knife, right?"
<Page16>
"――――――"
"......"
A chill runs down my spine.
She's staring at me so intensely that I almost forget
how to breathe.
<Page17>
"I see. I thought the     
were the stuff of fairy tales. Still, I guess there are
strange people out there.
Monstrous mutants like yourself, for example."
<Page18>
"Wha... what are you talking about? A vampire like you
has no right to call me a monster!"
"A monster is a monster. There don't even exist any
 who possess Mystic Eyes that can see the death
of things."
<Page19>
"The death... of things...?"
"What else would you call it?
Shiki. Your eyes are receiving from a transmission line
connected to a place no living being should be
connected to... Are those eyes something you were born
with?"
"No... They've been like this for a long time, but I
wasn't born with them."
<Page20>
"In that case, you must have experienced death at least
once before, right?"
"I'm not like you okay, I can't just die and come back.
But yes... I have. I almost died in an accident once.
It was only after that incident that I was able to see
the lines."
<Page21>
"Hmm. You must have had some sort of latent power, and
the accident was what awakened it... Mystic Eyes of
Death Perception, huh.
It all fits, you'd definitely be able to kill me if you
have eyes like that."
<Page22>
. Arcueid pouts and averts her gaze.
I'm glad she did. She'd been staring at me with visible
disgust in her eyes.
<Page23>
"Arcueid... do you know what these lines are?"
"I don't understand them as well as someone who can
actually see them like you, but I can fill you in on
some of the theory."
<Page24>
"What you're seeing is the conclusion of all things,
the points where things can easily die. Put simply, you
can see the fated end of all that exists... 'death'
itself."
"――――"
<Page25>
That's...
It's subtly different, but close enough to what Sensei
taught me when I received these glasses from her as a
child.
<Page26>
The conclusion of all things――their future.
Without even realizing what I was doing―――
I've spent all this time desperately trying not to be
conscious of them.
<Page27>
"What are you saying... Aren't these lines I see just
the places where things can be cut?"
<Page28>
"Like I said, those lines are 'death' itself.
Listen up, Shiki. Every single thing in this world has
an end.
When exactly that time comes will vary, but there's an
end nonetheless.
Death is not something that comes. It's with you from
the moment you're born, and eventually, it will
manifest itself. Simple cause and effect. You've heard
of the law of causality, haven't you?"
<Page29>
"Everything that has a beginning  have an end.
Atoms just recirculate; it's conservation of energy
right? The system will not tolerate any discrepancies;
not even the smallest error.
I mean, if there were any imbalances, the premise this
whole universe is based on would crumble. The universe
itself would disappear like a bubble popping."
<Page30>
Okay, even if that were all true―――
Isn't talking about the death of the universe blowing
things out of proportion a bit?
<Page31>
"It's not blowing things out of proportion at all!
I'm not kidding when I say that your eyes really are
that bad!"
"――――――"
<Page32>
"Listen. Everything in this world has its demise
determined in advance.
This applies to everyone, no matter how long-lived they
are or how mighty their existence. Even if someone had
a lifespan longer than that of the universe, that still
doesn't mean they'd go on living forever."
<Page33>
"This predetermined 'demise' is the 'fated end' of all
things.
Since it's something that's there from inception, if
you have the capacity to understand this conceptual
'fated end', as well as eyes and a brain whose
transmission lines are tuned in to it, then it stands
to reason that you'd be able to see it visually."
<Page34>
"That is the true nature of the 'lines' that you see.
If I were to theorize about it in human terms, I'd say
that it's something resembling an intrinsic flaw in
atomic bonds.
Or maybe it's more like a telomere, a self-destructive
genetic switch that manifests the cause of an
individual's death."
<Page35>
"Anyway, what you're seeing is the finality of death
itself: lines where things are prone to death.
I'm shocked you've managed to make it this far if you
see things like that. You must have a very tranquil
heart, Shiki."
<Page36>
Arcueid's statement is blunt.
"――――――"
I can't believe that she's really  insensitive.
Even though I understand her explanation, I don't want
to acknowledge any part of it.
<Page37>
"There's no way something like that exists, and even if
it did, I wouldn't be able to see it."
<Page38>
"But you  see it.
Normally, a living thing will die if you cut off its
head. If you decapitate something, it naturally follows
that it'll stop moving, right?
Conversely, you could say that a creature that can't be
decapitated is unkillable.# Oh, well, I guess that
applies to me but let's just leave that aside for now."
<Page39>
"What I'm trying to say is that you can defy that rule.
Even if you're up against an opponent that can nullify
anything that might be thrown at them, you can skip
ahead and 'kill' them. An opponent that's been killed
has to be 'dead' afterward, right?
It's not like you killed them by cutting off their
head.
Rather, you're able to kill them first, and then their
head becomes severed as a result."
<Page40>
"See, if that's not a monster, then what is?
You say they're just lines where things can be cut, but
those eyes of yours are more special than any other
ability that has ever existed up until now.
You see, Shiki―――your eyes grant you the ability to
kill everything around you. It's as though you have the
eyes of the Grim Reaper himself."
<Page41>
"........."
She's right.
I've made it all this way by trying not to be aware of
this, by not acknowledging it.
<Page42>
But the truth is that I've known this for a very long
time.
Just as Arcueid said, these eyes and this life can't be
anything more than a mistake as far as the world is
concerned.
<Page43>
Because ever since that day, I've been shown the end of
the world.
I've been forced to grapple with the possibility that
everything could fall apart at any second.
As long as I'm alive, I'm surrounded by it.
Smothered by these portents of death.
<Page44>
"So... what.
That means I can even kill someone like you. After all,
I'm a dangerous guy. I can kill anything."
"Really? Then let's give it a try."
<Page45>
Arcueid turns off all the lights and walks over to the
window.
She opens the curtains.
The previously hidden profusion of lights and details
comes into view.
The moonlight streaming through the window casts the
shadow of a pale figure.
<Page46>
"Come on, it's fine so don't hold back.
Oh, could it be that you can't see them with those
glasses on?"
<Page47>
"―――Are you sure about this?"
There's no way...
I place a hand on my glasses. I've never taken them off
in front of anyone else before.
<Page48>
I guess I've given in to despair after suffering
Arcueid's indictments...
Spurred on by my violent feelings, I take off my
glasses.
<Page49>
Lines squirm their way across the room#.#The world brims with death#.
<Page50>
"――――――#Huh?"
What I see before me is a miracle that makes me doubt
my own eyes.
<Page51>
A white moon hangs in the sky outside the window.
The lines, which are hard to see under the harsh light
of the sun―――
Are more than just visible under the faint illumination
of the moon. They're almost radiant.
<Page52>
But among them―――
The 'lines' on Arcueid's body are so thin and
insubstantial that I can barely see them. I have to
squint and pay close attention to make them out at all.
<Page53>
"But―――how?"
<Page54>
"What do you see? The lines must be almost invisible,
right?
I'm a being whose 'fated end' doesn't exist at night.
Because of that, you wouldn't be able to kill me, even
with those eyes of yours."
<Page55>
"Hmm, on second thought, I suppose you might still be
able to catch a glimpse of them.
Even though I can't be killed during the night, I still
have a 'fated end' during the day. That weak point is
what allowed you to kill me earlier. To make matters
worse I'd also just finished a big job, so my
resistance to instant death was lower than usual."
<Page56>
"At any rate, you ended up killing me, and so as you
can see I've ended up weak enough that I have a 'fated
end' even at night.
In other words, I'm not really immortal anymore,
but―――Shiki, do you think you'd be able to cut the
lines on my body?"
<Page57>
"――――"
I'm not really sure...
It's true that I can cut anything that has a line
running across it.
Even so, I don't think I'd be able to cut them as
deftly as I did back then, running them through in
under a second.
<Page58>
"I think it'd be pretty hard... The lines keep
appearing and disappearing, so I probably couldn't do
it unless you were asleep."
<Page59>
"Right? That right there is your biggest flaw.
It doesn't matter how well you can see 'death' unless
you're able to reach those 'lines' with your own hands.
I may be weak right now, but I'm far from being so
feeble that you'd be able to catch me."
<Page60>
I see...
As she says, there's no way I'd be able to keep up with
a nimble animal, much less catch one.
And I can't lay a finger on their lines if I can't even
catch them in the first place.
<Page61>
To sum it up, even if I can see these 'lines', it
doesn't mean that I can kill a moving target.
The fear that had gripped me lessened somewhat at these
words, and I was able to laugh off my inhuman nature.
<Page62>
Yes, it's a funny story. A joke that brings me a sense
of comfort.
No matter what metaphors or shortcomings I'm taught,
the world that I've been looking at my whole life will
not change.
In this world, I'm a defective part that mustn't be
allowed to join in with the others.
<Page63>
Ah, but even so――――
There's no way I can spare any thought for such
ordinary concerns.
Not with an unimaginable sight like this before me.
<Page64>
A beautiful flower suffused with moonlight.
That's right... I don't want eternity or anything like
that.
But, the thought of something in this world that even I
can touch―――
I want to live holding onto that hope.
<Page65>
"―――."
I feel the sudden twinge of a headache.
Looking at all these lines gives me a headache. I put
on my glasses, and the miraculous scene before me fades
back to reality.
<Page66>
"........."
Arcueid is eyeing me suspiciously.
<Page67>
"What...? Is there something else you want to say?"
<Page68>
"No, that's not it.
Do you not see the lines if you wear those glasses?"
<Page69>
"Ah... yeah.
They were given to me by someone I met a long time ago,
back when my eyes first became like this.
Only the lenses are original at this point, but it's
thanks to these that I'm able to lead a normal life."
<Page70>
"I see, I guess that makes sense.
It doesn't matter how strong your mind is, you'd
eventually either go insane or gouge your eyes out if
you had to look at death all the time."
<Page71>
"Excuse me... You've been spouting off about some
disturbing stuff for a while now. Please just give me a
break already. Also, you're way too close. Stop. Just
stop right there. I'll throw a vase at you if you don't
stop!"
<Page72>
Sensing danger, I back away.
However, my threat was entirely ineffective against the
big cat in front of me, and Arcueid continues to prowl
nearer with a keen curiosity.
<Page73>
"Hey. Lemme see those for a sec."
"―――No way. These are important to me, I'm not
handing them over."
<Page74>
"It's not like I'm going to break them.
Come on. It's okay if I just take a look, right?"
<Page75>
What kind of stupid nonsense is she saying...?
I―――
C:> Give up and hand them over.
C:> Refuse... No way am I handing these over.
