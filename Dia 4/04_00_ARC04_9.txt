"Ten people... maybe that's too few...?"
"Yeah, that's not even close at all."
"Mmm. Then how about a hundred?"
"Bad luck, that's another miss."
"...! In that case, a thousand!?"
"Sorry, that's also a big fat no."
<Page2>
Arcueid makes a strange chuckling sound.
It's not like I'm angry or anything... so why do I feel
so incredibly frustrated?
<Page3>
"Alright, I'm really going out on a limb here, but
there's no way it's ten thousand...?"
"That's also wrong. Tens, hundreds, thousands... so
this is how you really see me, huh. How awful, wouldn't
that make me the same as all the other vampires?"
<Page4>
"Aren't you...? I thought all vampires  the same.
I mean, humans get hungry simply by existing. If you
vampires have to suck blood to survive, then wouldn't
there be no limit to how much you need?"
"That's true. What you said is correct, but..."
<Page5>
"I haven't personally sucked blood even once in the
past 800 years. On top of that, I've never killed an
ordinary person either."
<Page6>
...
Even I can tell that that's a pretty strange thing for
a vampire to say.
But, more importantly―――
<Page7>
"Hold on, you're joking, right?"
"I'm serious. You see, the thought of sucking blood is
really scary for me."
<Page8>
"Let me get this straight, you're a vampire, but you're
afraid of sucking blood?"
"I'm just a coward, I suppose.
That's why no matter what happens, I'll always be a
failure of a bloodsucker."
<Page9>
As she mutters those words, Arcueid looks out through
the window at the night sky.
For a long time, the woman in white simply stares up at
the sky.
Viewed from behind, her figure is as indistinct and
hazy as that of a phantom.
<Page10>
"I see... A failure, huh."
I put a hand on my chest as I mutter those words.
Huh...? This feeling, am I... relieved?
Why is that, I wonder. That doesn't make any sense.
<Page11>
"What's wrong, Shiki?"
"No, it's nothing. I was just laughing at how much of a
chicken you are."
"Chicken? Why do you think I'm a bird?"
<Page12>
Arcueid tilts her head in confusion.
You'd never think she was a vampire based on the way
she looks.
Of course... It makes total sense I'd feel relieved.
After all, it's just been made clear that the woman in
front of me isn't a bad person after all. Why 
I be relieved?
<Page13>
At any rate, if I believe what Arcueid just said, then
I don't need to worry about her turning around and
killing me out of the blue.
That's why I feel safe. Well... Feeling safe is part of
it, but there's another――very different――thing I'm
relieved about.
<Page14>
Geez... What am I thinking?
I can't believe my feelings are so out of whack that
I'm happy about the fact that Arcueid is a failure as a
vampire.
<Page15>
"Huh...?"
I'm suddenly struck by a dizzying headache. Maybe I
relaxed a little too much while talking with Arcueid.
<Page16>
"Hm?"
A white haze clouds my vision.
This is... not the usual chronic anemia.
I'm still able to think clearly.
I just have a faint headache and a strange chill―――
<Page17>
"What's wrong, Shiki?
Your forehead is dripping with sweat."
"Sweat...?"
<Page18>
I put a hand to my forehead to confirm. Arcueid's
right, I'm sweating so much that my hand comes away
soaked.
This is strange... It's not like we're in a sauna, why
am I sweating so heavily?
With rising unease in my chest, I look over at the
digital clock in the room.
<Page19>
The clock reads 4:32 AM.
The temperature has dropped to 11℃ with the morning
chill.
I shouldn't be sweating nearly this much in this
weather.
<Page20>
No, actually―――
This room feels as hot as a midsummer heatwave...!
<Page21>
"Arcueid. Aren't you feeling hot?"
"Hm? No, it isn't really hot enough to hamper my
mobility. It's only what, 38℃ in here? I may be weaker
than usual, but I should still be able to handle
temperatures up to about 3000℃."
<Page22>
It was stupid of me to ask.
3000℃? Can you not even burn a vampire with a
blowtorch!?
<Page23>
No... I'll have to save that question for another time.
The display on the clock hasn't budged from 11℃.
Either the machine is on the fritz or something's wrong
with my ability to tell what temperature it is.
As I look around the room trying to spot something else
with a temperature readout―――
"――――――What the hell... is that?"
My eyes end up glued to the monitor installed in the
room; the one with the video feed of the hotel lobby.
<Page24>
"It's... burning...?"
I can't believe my eyes.
It's a scene straight out of a movie.
<Page25>
The flames splash and spill outwards in waves.
A human-shaped figure writhes around, black smoke
pouring off it.
A large carnivore is greedily devouring that 'figure'.
<Page26>
"Arcueid...!"
"........."
Arcueid doesn't say a word.
Is that hostility... no, contempt in her eyes?
She's staring at the monitor, her emotions totally
different to mine.
<Page27>
It takes less than a minute for the lobby to sink below
the sea of flames.
The fire alarms do not ring.
The thermometer doesn't rise.
I'm still sweating profusely, and my throat is parched
from just breathing.
<Page28>
There is nothing left to think about.
It's the enemy. Those burning corpses from this
afternoon―――those things have come to this hotel...!
<Page29>
"Shit...!"
I run to the window to see what's happening outside.
<Page30>
There's no change in the cityscape.
Despite the towering flames, none of the people outside
seem to have noticed anything out of the ordinary.
Nobody is making their way into the hotel, nor is there
anyone trying to escape from it.
<Page31>
"What the hell is going on, Arcueid?!"
"........."
<Page32>
Arcueid is stubbornly keeping her mouth shut.
<Page33>
"―――――"
The seconds tick away.
The temperature in the room continues to climb. It
feels as though my skin is about to roast.
<Page34>
I don't know what's going on outside in the corridor.
I don't know what's going on downstairs either.
All I know is that a niggling voice in the back of my
mind is telling me that it's already too late.
<Page35>
Arcueid still hasn't said anything.
Is she anxious? Or maybe frustrated?
She's just standing there motionless, clutching herself
as though trying to hold something back.
<Page36>
She'd said something about how she wasn't going to
leave this room.
I'm pretty sure that was her way of saying she's not
strong enough to do anything right now.
If that's the case―――
What should I be doing in this situation?
C:> Leave the room and see what's going on outside.
C:> I'll stay in the room and see what happens.
