<Page1>
"Yeah, this is a pretty nice room.
I don't think anyone could complain about spending a
night in here."
<Page2>
Arcueid happily looks around the hotel room.
"――――"
I'm left speechless by this turn of events.
<Page3>
"So, what do you want me to do specifically?"
"Let's start by getting out of here.
Let's see, my room probably isn't the best place to
hole up... Aha, how about we head somewhere that's
higher up and has a better view?"
<Page4>
And so, here we are.
Arcueid flagged down a taxi on the main street and we
took it to the next town over.
She checked us into a room at one of the most expensive
hotels in the area. Well, I say room―――she actually
booked out the entire top floor. It was like she's a
celebrity.
<Page5>
"Wow, it's so tall!
Human architecture really is advancing at a remarkable
pace.
What's the phrase people use for this again? ' to
the '? Or wait, was it 'Progress marches on'?
Well, it doesn't really matter! Ooh, ooh, over there,
Shiki! The alleyway we were just in is so tiny now!"
<Page6>
Arcueid has opened a small gap for herself in the
curtains and seems to be having fun looking at the
scenery through the window.
I am by no means in the mood for this.
<Page7>
This place isn't a hotel room so much as a fortress
that happens to have been built on top of a hotel.
The blackout curtains, the furniture that decorates the
room, and even the materials used for the walls and
doors are significantly more luxurious and sturdy than
the ones you'd find in your average hotel.
<Page8>
Since we've rented out the entire top floor, no other
guests will come up here. This room even has a monitor
that shows what's happening in the lobby on the first
floor.
I'm struck once again by how the pedigreed people that
use hotel rooms like this are like a totally different
breed to the rest of us...
<Page9>
"Let's hide out here tonight. Oh, and don't worry about
the hotel fee.# I'm rich, so I'll treat you."
<Page10>
Speaking cheerfully, Arcueid pulls away from the
window.
She said it was a great lookout spot, but it appears
she is already tired of the bird's-eye view of the
city.
<Page11>
"Arcueid... What on earth are you thinking?"
I let out a sigh.
<Page12>
"What do you mean, I'm thinking about a lot of things."
"No, that's not the point.
I mean sharing a hotel room with a man―――"
<Page13>
I was about to say something, but I stop.
My role here is just to be a lookout for this
self-proclaimed vampire.
I don't have to say anything superfluous.
<Page14>
"No, it's fine. Do what you want."
"You're a weird one, Shiki.
You're so unpredictable, getting angry all of a sudden
and then going silent."
I'm not sure what's so funny, but Arcueid is laughing.
<Page15>
"......"
Meanwhile, I'm standing right next to the door, still
very much on edge, keeping a watchful eye over the
entire room.
I'm the complete opposite of the relaxed Arcueid.
<Page16>
I'm exhausted and desperately want to rest, but if I
were to sit down on the sofa now, I can all but
guarantee I'd be out like a light.
No matter how desperate I get, I can't allow myself to
become that defenseless.
<Page17>
"Shiki, do you want something to drink? It looks like
there's a whole bunch to choose from here!"
"........."
I hear a carefree voice coming from over by the
minibar.
Needless to say... the bottle in Arcueid's hand is some
form of alcohol.
<Page18>
"Look here. Why are you pushing alcohol when you're
undera―――"
I bite my tongue mid-sentence.
I'm not actually sure whether she's underage or not. I
don't care to know though, so I'm not about to ask.
<Page19>
"I'll pick out something myself later. More
importantly―――"
No matter how tired or bewildered I am, there's
something I have to clear up.
<Page20>
What  this woman in front of me?
In other words, how dangerous is the situation I'm in
right now?
Even if the answer defies common sense, I can't sit
down and relax on the couch without first trying to
understand things as best I can.
<Page21>
"More importantly, there's something that I need to ask
you.
I can't sit back and relax until I do."
<Page22>
"Hm? I don't mind, but what's the matter? You're acting
very serious all of a sudden."
"........."
Well of course I seem serious, I haven't let my guard
down for even a second since I ran into you... Anyway,
that aside―――
<Page23>
"This is important.
At the end of the day, what are you really trying to
accomplish?"
<Page24>
"Me? I'm just chasing after that vampire.
Eliminating vampires is my duty after all."
"Yeah, I seem to recall you saying that earlier.
But you're a vampire too, aren't you?"
<Page25>
"What, are you saying that you still don't believe me
Shiki?"
<Page26>
"Relax, I don't like it but I believe you.
What I'm trying to say is, why would a  like
yourself be going out killing  ? That
doesn't make any logical sense."
"Oh, so you don't like it when members of the same
species kill each other?"
<Page27>
"I'd prefer it if they didn't kill members of other
species either.
But look... vampires are demons that suck the blood of
humans, right? Then shouldn't your target be humans and
not other vampires?
Wouldn't the people you kill be, you know―――"
If it's blood you're after, then wouldn't it make more
sense to target humans...?
<Page28>
"The act of sucking blood and the act of killing are
two different things.
Still, I understand what you're getting at. You're
saying that we should help each other because we're the
same species, right?
However, even though vampires are all derived from the
same greater <origin|p r o g e n i t o r  >, each one is a unique species that
has evolved differently from all the others.
We don't have the same sense of fellowship that humans
do."
<Page29>
"Huh...? So, does that mean the vampire that you're
looking for is different from you?"
<Page30>
"Yeah, it's a different species of bloodsucker from me.
The vampire I'm chasing is a  , so they're
more in line with the image you have of what a vampire
is.
They suck human blood and convert the people they kill
into familiars to gradually increase their power.
You remember those burning Dead from this morning,
right? That's what happens to people killed by
vampires. Even though they are dead as humans, they
cannot truly die and continue as the living dead."
<Page31>
"They're dead, but they're still alive..."
The corpses that appeared in the alleyway... According
to the legends about vampires, people whose blood has
been sucked become new vampires and attack people.
As they keep doing this and growing their numbers, they
eventually turn the entire village into a land of
death... or so it goes.
<Page32>
"Yes. That's the kind of vampire that lurks in this
city.
I have no interest in sucking blood, and I'm no ally of
theirs. As such, I have no problem with killing these
other vampires."
<Page33>
Arcueid says this matter-of-factly.
It appears that there are many different types of
vampires.
<Page34>
"I'm starting to feel a bit shaken by all this...
So you're telling me that the reason you told me to
become your shield was so you could kill him."
<Page35>
"Yes, that was my intention at first.
I was planning on using you as a shield whether you
liked it or not. If you'd tried to run away, I would
have bound you with my   and run you into the
ground through the power of overwhelming fear.
But as I was talking to you, I started to change my
mind."
<Page36>
So she was planning to use force from the beginning...
Okay, I'll have to make sure to remember that.
"You changed your mind? Why?"
<Page37>
"Hmm, I guess because I was wrong about you.
You know what, Shiki? I spent the entire time between
when you killed me and when I revived under the
impression that you were a member of the .
If you  been, there was a chance you might have
known where the enemy was, and I'd have been able to
count on you as a force to be reckoned with."
<Page38>
"But you ended up being a completely ordinary person.
You didn't even know the first thing about vampires,
let alone the location of the enemy's coffin."
<Page39>
"Yeah... there's no way they'd send an  to an
atheist country like this in the first place. Not to
mention that they wouldn't be operating alone. Their
policy is to always move in master-disciple pairs after
all..."
<Page40>
Arcueid is off mumbling to herself.
The conversation seems to have gone off the rails a
bit, but I'm just happy not to be the subject anymore.
<Page41>
"All that to say, you're not the one I'm after anymore.
I'm back to chasing after my original prey.
Which is kind of a bummer, I guess."
<Page42>
Her voice is sprightly, but her words are disturbing.
Damn... This woman still has it out for me, doesn't
she?
Even though it's natural for her to hate me after what
I did, it's not good for my heart to hear her say 'I
want to kill you' with a smile.
Seems like she really is planning on killing me the
moment I let my guard down―――
<Page43>
"Are we done with the serious stuff? Well then, time
for bed!"
"Wha?"
And then,# with a spring in her step,# she strolls over
to the bed and flops down onto it.
<Page44>
"This feels pretty good, so I'll sleep until the sun
goes down.
Ah, Shiki, you should also get some rest while you can.
Vampires can't be active during the day, so I don't
need you to be on lookout until nightfall."
<Page45>
"You... do understand that you've just said something
that negates your entire existence, right?"
"It doesn't bother .
―――Oh, I think I've reached my limit. Well then,
good night, Shiki. Wake me up when the sun goes down,
okay?"
<Page46>
"H-Hey!"
"―――――――"
Arcueid suddenly falls asleep like a car that's had its
engine turned off.
<Page47>
"―――――Seriously?"
Unbelievable. She's really asleep...
I feel like an idiot for spending the entire time
hovering by the door in case I needed to make a run for
it.
<Page48>
Is this okay? I know it's not for me to say, but is she
really fine with this?
I was dragged here more or less against my will. I
could easily make my escape right now.
<Page49>
No, what's more―――
Even though I don't have the same urges I had back
then―――
"I've already killed you once, you know..."
How is this woman still able to fall asleep so
carelessly?
<Page50>
"............"
I stare at Arcueid's face.
Judging by the gentle rise and fall of her well-rounded
chest, it seems she's still breathing.
She lies on the bed, her body perfectly still.
<Page51>
She looks like a work of art in repose.
Softly closed eyelids.
Long eyelashes, and pretty lips that look vibrant even
without lipstick.
<Page52>
The swell of her chest is very shapely.
The line of her hips is like a hill disappearing into
the horizon.
Her smooth and slender legs are stretched out across
the bed.
Demure, yet sensual; such contradictory words come to
my mind.
<Page53>
"........."
A woman like that is fast asleep and defenseless in
this royal suite.
I've only known her for a short time, and yet she
trusts me, the person who brutally killed her, from the
bottom of her heart.
<Page54>
"She really is an idiot, isn't she?"
Yeah... she's so stupidly honest it's enough to make
you worry for her.
<Page55>
In any case, this is a critical juncture.
This may be the final crossroads where Tohno Shiki has
a chance to turn back.
<Page56>
She said 'I'll have you be my shield'.
But I...
C:> ...Have had enough of this madness. I'll run away.
C:> ...Won't lose my way again. I'll stay.
