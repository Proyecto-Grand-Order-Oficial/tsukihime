"I―――"
There's no way that I can say I can't do it.
<Page2>
I killed this person.
As a result, she's weak and is asking for help.
Plus... I've only talked with her a little bit, but I
get the feeling she's not a bad person―――
<Page3>
"Well, what do you think?
Or is it really impossible for a human like you to work
together with a vampire like me?"
<Page4>
"Of course it is. So you do get it after all."
<Page5>
"――――"
Come on, please don't give me that look.
I'll feel so guilty that I won't be able to say no.
<Page6>
"But... I've made my bed, now I have to lie in it.
My conscience wouldn't let me rest easy if I feigned
ignorance about what just happened here."
It's obvious that I'll regret this later...
But even so―――
<Page7>
"On top of that... your opponent is the man responsible
for the serial killings, right?
If he is, then as a resident of this city, it'd be
remiss of me to not help you as best I can."
<Page8>
Agreeing to help her is at least a little better than
having to avert my eyes from her penetrating gaze.
<Page9>
"So then, that means―――"
"I'm not going to be your shield... but I'll at least
stand guard."
"――――――"
<Page10>
...Would you look at that.
What's up with that face?
She can die and come back to life, make a tornado with
a wave of her hand, and now this. She really is the
complete package.
<Page11>
"That's great! Sounds like we have ourselves a deal."
The woman reaches her hand out to me.
<Page12>
"I can finally introduce myself.
I'm Arcueid―――well, it's a bit of a long name, so
you can just call me Arcueid.
I'm from the   caste of vampires, what sort
of human are you?"
<Page13>
I heave a sigh as I'm subjected to a self-introduction
unlike any I've ever heard before.
I'm not entirely sure whether it's a sigh of exhausted
resignation, or evidence that I've finally accepted
this unbelievable situation.
<Page14>
"I'm Tohno Shiki. Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm just
a student.
I already mentioned this earlier, but I really am of no
use to you."
<Page15>
I take hold of the woma―――of  hand.
She takes a long hard look at me, and then―――
She asks me to shake hands with her.
<Page16>
"I look forward to working with you, Shiki.
I'll be sure to have you take full responsibility for
killing me back then."
<Page17>
Arcueid smiles and holds out her left hand.
I'm sure there are many ways to make amends in this
world... But I'm probably both the first and last
person to take responsibility by helping the very
person I killed.
<Page18>
"Man... this really is insane."
Still, there's nothing else I can do right now.
I reluctantly hold out my left hand and shake hands
with the woman in white who calls herself a vampire.
