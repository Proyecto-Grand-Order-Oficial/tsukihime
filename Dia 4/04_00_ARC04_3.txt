<Page1>
"Have a nice day."
As usual, Hisui sees me off as I leave the main gate.
<Page2>
Except this time―――
Hisui stares at me, then takes a small breath as if to
muster up enough courage to continue speaking.
<Page3>
"Shiki-sama... What happened yesterday?"
<Page4>
"Nothing in particular. I started feeling sick at
school, so I left early and was on my way back here
when―――"
―――When I what?
"―――I stopped in the park to rest, that's all.
...Still, I can't deny that Akiha was right. It 
careless of me. I'll be more careful from now on."
<Page5>
"I do not mean to criticize you.
It's just that you seemed to be overexerting yourself
this morning...# Please take care on the road."
<Page6>
Hisui must have considered saying even those few words
to be overstepping her bounds.
Bowing especially deeply, she sends me on my way.
<Page7>
As I approach the school, I see more and more people
wearing school uniforms.
The time is 7:45.
Nobody seems to be in any particular rush to get to
school, probably because there's still plenty of time
before homeroom.
<Page8>
Of course that goes for me too.
This morning I can start my day as usual without having
to worry about being late――or anything else for that
matter.
<Page9>
After I cross this intersection, it's only a little
ways to the main gate.
The traffic light turns red, and I stop in front of the
crosswalk.
Beyond the crosswalk is the wall of the school.
The path to the school is protected by a guardrail, and
even now students are jostling their way toward the
school gate.
<Page10>
Excluding the students from my school, there isn't
anybody else on the sidewalk at this time of day.
Or at least, there  have been.
And yet, through the gaps between the cars racing by, I
think I caught a glimpse of a figure in white.
<Page11>
"Wha―――――"
Over there was a woman.
An unmistakable, white figure.
Golden hair that reminds me of sunlight.
Long, thin eyebrows and red eyes.
I've only seen her once, but there's no way I could
mistake her for anyone else.
<Page12>
"――――――"
But, it can't be her.
Because yesterday, with my own two hands, I tore that
woman to pieces―――
<Page13>
"――――――"
No, that's not true.
It was nothing more than a bad dream; Hisui, Akiha, and
even Kohaku-san all said――――
"――――――"
They didn't say anything of the sort.
<Page14>
I'd just been desperate to believe that they had.
Which means that  wasn't a dream. It was real.
I killed her.
I killed her.
I killed her.
I definitely killed her, there's no doubt about
it―――
<Page15>
"――――――."
But then, if I did―――
How... how could she...
How could she be here?
How could she be right here, in front of me...?
<Page16>
The light turns green.
The students around me are walking across to the other
side.
I alone stand stock-still amidst the crowd, too stunned
to move.
The woman is sitting on the guardrail, swinging her
legs aimlessly.
<Page17>
It's as if she's waiting for someone.
I have no idea how long she's been waiting, but there's
nothing grim about her expression.
<Page18>
―――I wonder who she's waiting for.
She's fidgety and restless, as if she's waiting for her
lover.
<Page19>
No, hold on... She's waiting?
Who is she waiting for?
It's obvious. That much is obvious.
I'm sure I'd do the same.
In fact, anyone would do the same.
If someone were to kill me―――
I wouldn't even have to think about who I'd want to see
first.
<Page20>
―――I have a bad feeling about this.
A shiver runs down my spine like a centipede crawling
on my back.
It feels like my spine's about to burst out of my
mouth.
<Page21>
The woman in white looks at me.
Our gazes meet. Our thoughts align. It all makes
perfect sense.
No. It's just a coincidence. It  to be a
coincidence.
I've never come into contact with this woman. I have no
connection to her. She has nothing to do with me.
<Page22>
She's just a stranger who looks like her.
She must be waiting for someone else.
If she isn't, then I'm living in a nightmare.
I mean, just think about it, there's no way that a dead
person―――a person who was dismembered that
thoroughly―――could possibly still be alive.
<Page23>
And yet, that woman is alive, and smiling at me.
A smile that says, 'so you're finally here'.
She seems deeply satisfied to have found the person who
killed her.
<Page24>
The woman smiles warmly and waves at me, then stands up
from the guardrail.
She starts walking over to where I stand frozen in
place, her hair fluttering softly.
<Page25>
"What the hell―――――is going on?"
This is... a bad dream.
The light turns red.
<Page26>
"Don't come――――don't come, don't come――――"
The woman walks straight across the road, not seeming
to care about the cars racing by.
<Page27>
She's barely three meters away now.
I don't know if this is a dream, or if it's really
happening.
"I told you――――not to come any closer――――!!"
<Page28>
No matter how loud I shout, the reality in front of me
remains the same.
So I just run away from the woman in white.
<Page29>
I run.
I run as fast as I can.
Without any regard for shame or appearances, I keep
running as fast as I can along the asphalt road,
knocking other pedestrians out of my way.
<Page30>
"   ―――――!"
My breathing is ragged and my heart is pounding in
agony.
Even so, I run.
My facial expression is locked into a grimace.
<Page31>
My vision is distorted by tears. My throat is burning.
My lungs are shriveling up.
The muscles in my hands are trembling so violently that
they feel like they're about to rip themselves apart.
<Page32>
My legs have forgotten how to move and are just kicking
haphazardly at the ground. With each step I take, a
numbing pain shoots through my thigh.
But that's okay. I don't care if my legs get torn off.
Because if I don't run, I'll go crazy.
<Page33>
I look behind me.
The woman in white is walking toward me.
She's definitely following me.
The woman I killed is chasing me.
That itself is more than enough reason for my frenzy.
<Page34>
"  ――――――!"
My heart feels like it's about to explode, but I ignore
it and keep on running.
When I look behind me, she's still there.
She's chasing me with footsteps as light as a feather.
<Page35>
"   ―――――!"
My head is tilted back.
My arms are limp.
I lost all feeling in my legs a long time ago.
So why is it, if I'm running as fast as I possibly can,
that I can't shake off a person that's only walking?!
<Page36>
"   ――――"
I'm breathing even harder.
I've been running at full tilt for who knows how many
kilometers now.
Yet when I look back, I can still see her walking
toward me.
She's walking calmly, as though just out for a stroll,
but she's still matching my pace perfectly.
She's like a ghost, burned into a rearview mirror.
<Page37>
"......   ."
I laugh, even though there's nothing funny about this
situation. Even as I laugh, I keep on running.
<Page38>
"  !"
I can't stop laughing.
But I still run. Even though my body is screaming at me
that I'll die if I run any further, I still run.
<Page39>
It should be obvious why I'm running.
If she catches up to me, she'll kill me for sure.
I laugh it off, but I know better than anyone that it's
just a way for me to cope.
<Page40>
There is no need for any reason or rationale.
This is just the natural rule of karma that everyone
knows.
<Page41>
Those who kill will be killed in return.
Since I killed her, she has the right to kill me.
That's why―――
It's just a fact that my life will end the moment I'm
cornered.
<Page42>
"..."
I collapse to the ground in a heap.
It's not that I tripped so much as I couldn't force my
limbs to take even one more step, and just came
crashing down.
<Page43>
"... ...!"
Crawling along the ground, I somehow manage to make it
over to the base of the wall.
<Page44>
I put my hands on the wall and try to stand up, but
it's no use.
As soon as I stand up, the strength drains from my legs
and I fall on my backside with a thud.
Sprawled there, my body now refuses to even budge.
<Page45>
"――― ―――"
I tilt my head back and breathe in.
―――I'm in agony.
I don't have enough oxygen at all.
As a result, my brain isn't ticking over properly.
I can't even make sense of what I'm doing.
I don't know why I'm doing this.
Why. Why. Why is the woman that I killed still alive?
<Page46>
I killed that woman.
I killed her, completely and utterly.
So then how―――how could she be waiting for me in
front of the school with a smile on her face?
<Page47>
"I could have sworn... I killed you."
―――That's right.
I killed her.
I Killed Her.
I KILLED HER.
Why, Why, Why, Why, Why,
Why, Why, Why, Why, Why,
Why, Why, Why, Why, Why――――――?!
<Page48>
"Oh, are we done playing tag?"
.
A dry sound echoes through the back alley.
<Page49>
The woman that pursued me with floating footsteps
shrugs her shoulders in disappointment, turns to me as
I lean slumped against the wall, and says:
"Hello. Thank you so much for your hospitality
yesterday."
She gives me a big, carefree smile.
<Page50>
"......!"
I feel like I'm going crazy.
I don't know why she's making that face.
Still smiling, the woman brazenly strolls into the
dead-end alleyway.
<Page51>
"Also here, you forgot this.
It'd be a problem for you if you left something behind
that could be used as evidence, right?"
<Page52>
She lobs a black object my way.
It's my bag―――I hadn't even realized that I'd lost
it.
<Page53>
No, wait, what did she just say...?
Evidence? Evidence of , exactly...?
<Page54>
"No―――run, run...!"
With escape on my mind I manage to move my feet, but
there's a concrete wall behind me, so I can't retreat
any further.
<Page55>
"Hmm? I thought we were done playing tag.
This alley's a dead end after all. Plus, there's nobody
around, so there's no need to worry about anyone
getting in the way."
<Page56>
The woman keeps smiling, as though delighted by all
this.
...Dead-end alleyway? No one around?
I frantically cast my eyes around my surroundings and
am disgusted by my own stupidity.
Fleeing to a place like this is like  to be
killed...!
<Page57>
"It took me a long time.
Eighteen hours later, I finally caught you."
I hear a  as the woman takes another step into the
alleyway.
<Page58>
"Y-You're――――"
"What?"
"You're, definitely――――"
<Page59>
"Yeah. I'm the woman you killed yesterday.
I'm glad you remember me."
It was a reply I didn't want to hear, regardless of
whether it was a lie or the truth.
<Page60>
"―――Don't be ridiculous! A person who's dead can't
possibly be alive!"
"Sure, but I don't see what you're so surprised about?
I was killed, but then I just came back to life again
afterward."
<Page61>
The woman replies lightly, her footsteps continuing to
echo down the alleyway.
The distance between us is getting smaller and smaller.
<Page62>
"Came back... to life?"
I mull over the woman's words, stunned.
She came back to life...?
As in, she was on the verge of death but recovered?
Meaning that she went to a doctor, underwent surgery,
and managed to spring back... from  state?
<Page63>
"Don't be ridiculous!
There isn't a human alive that could come back to life
after being dismembered like that...!"
<Page64>
"Yeah. But you see, I'm not human."
"―――――Huh?"
Her words were so simple that, well, there's no other
way for them to be interpreted.
<Page65>
'I'm not a human being.'
There's no denying that's what the woman in front of me
said.
<Page66>
"You're not... human...?"
"Of course not. Do you think there are people who can
regenerate themselves after being torn limb from limb?"
"―――――――"
Of course not, there's no way a human could do that.
If they could, they wouldn't be human at
all―――they'd be a different creature altogether, one
that only  like a person.
<Page67>
Even if you kill them, they come back to life.
Even if you strangle them, they don't care.
Even if you tear them apart, they'll knit themselves
back together and start moving again.
They take the form of a human, but they can hardly be
called a human.
<Page68>
"―――――――――"
That seems to be the true form of the woman in front of
me.
I try to laugh, but my throat is so parched and stiff
that I can't even laugh properly.
<Page69>
"...What are you talking about?"
If this is a joke, it's in poor taste―――
But this is all far too much of a coincidence for me to
write it off as a joke.
<Page70>
I mean, it all fits.
If this woman isn't human, then it isn't so far-fetched
that she could still be alive even after I killed her.
<Page71>
"... , ..."
My mind stops racing.
I remember what the person who saved me when I was a
child told me.
For now, I need to focus.
This is the sort of situation that's going to require
some careful thought.
<Page72>
"Earlier, you said that you aren't human.
In that case, what are you?"
<Page73>
"Me?# I guess you could call me a vampire.
To put it simply, I'm a monster that lives off human
blood."
<Page74>
...Good.
Why is this good? Firstly, because the word 'vampire'
is at least easy to understand.
<Page75>
Even I know a thing or two about them.
They may be made-up, but the word 'vampire' is very
well-known.
An immortal creature in human form. The concept was
created by the novelist Bram Stoker, and shows up in
fiction from the West.
<Page76>
Secondly, and most importantly, the name alone gives
you an idea of what they are.
A blood-sucking demon. If she's referring to herself as
a demon, then it obviously follows that she's not
human.
<Page77>
"I see, so you're a vampire―――"
It's so patently absurd that I almost burst out
laughing.
Even though I'm going to be killed right after this, I
feel a little more at ease.
I guess I've reached the point where I just don't care
anymore.
<Page78>
As I lie here in a heap, having completely abandoned
myself to fate, the woman looks down at me with a
satisfied expression on her face.
<Page79>
...Hold on, I thought the general consensus was that
vampires can't be out and about during the day?
Well, I guess I have other things I should be worrying
about right now.
<Page80>
"...So.
What does a monster like you want from me?"
<Page81>
Giving into despair, I spit out those words.
For some reason, the woman backs away.
Only for a moment though―――the next instant, she
folds her hands in front of her chest and starts
scowling sullenly at me.
<Page82>
"I'm shocked. Did you already forget what you did to me
yesterday?
You dismembered me――a complete stranger――the moment
you laid eyes on me. And yet, here you are, asking me
what I want with you like you're totally used to this
kind of thing."
<Page83>
The woman isn't really angry so much as astonished...
Though, I have to say I feel the same way right now.
I mean, the woman I killed with my own two hands is
complaining to me about how I dared to kill her.
<Page84>
"Hey. Are you listening, you homicidal maniac?"
"...Yeah, I'm listening. I'm just trying to wrap my
head around the fact that I've had some pretty bad
luck.
I'm sorry, but I need you to shut up for a second."
<Page85>
I say that, but I really just want to lash out at
something.
If I don't, I might go so far as to commit suicide.
<Page86>
After all this time, it finally sinks in just how bad
my luck really is.
I ran across a woman who I suddenly felt like killing
for no reason―――
Then I let my impulses get the better of me, and
actually killed her.
<Page87>
After that my memories were a bit hazy so I wrote it
all off as a dream, except not only did it really
happen, but to top it all off, the person I killed
isn't even human.
I've always thought of myself as a misfit――as damaged
goods. But compared to this situation, I'm downright
normal...!
<Page88>
After that, I was wracked by anguish and despair.
I finally decided that I'd make amends in my own
way―――
Only to discover that the person I killed isn't even
human!
<Page89>
"――――――――― ."
I can't help but laugh.
...Still, there's a silver lining to all this.
<Page90>
Since the person I killed has come back to life, it's
like I never actually killed anyone.
Well, I guess the act of 'killing' still remains, but
she's alive at least.
I think that alone is something to be happy about.
<Page91>
...Yeah. In that case, I can do this.
Tohno Shiki can go back to his normal life from before.
<Page92>
Sure, I'm being hunted down by some monster, but I'll
take that over being a murderer any day.
Bad luck is bad luck, but this is  bad
luck.
If this whole ridiculous story is true, then I'm not
the only one who's crazy.
<Page93>
"...Okay, I've calmed down.
You have something to say, don't you? Go ahead and get
whatever complaints or grudges you may have off your
chest."
<Page94>
"Well yeah, there's a lot I want to say, but... you're
a strange one. You're face to face with a vampire,
what's with that attitude?"
"Sorry, I'm pretty riled up right now... If I don't act
this way, there's a good chance I'd kill 
instead."
<Page95>
If you're going to kill me, then do it already.
I've been dealing with this abnormal body for seven
years.
No matter how horrible an event is, if it happens right
in front of my eyes, I'm more than able to accept it as
reality.
That said, never in my wildest dreams could I have
imagined a case like this.
<Page96>
"Hmmm..."
The woman stares at me.
Her gaze is sharp, but there's no hostility in it.
<Page97>
This is weird... I feel like most people would agree
that if you get hit, you hit back. Shouldn't this woman
be itching to kill me...?
<Page98>
"...Why're you staring at me?
Aren't you here to get revenge? Then―――"
<Page99>
"You're right, if someone kills you, then if you're
doing things by the book, you should kill them right
back.
If that's what you want, I'll do it, but I'd rather
pass for now. The costs and benefits wouldn't really
balance out."
The woman stares me dead in the eye.
<Page100>
"Hey, do you regret what you did?"
"...Huh?"
<Page101>
I just stare vacantly at her for a moment, stunned.
What she just said sounded like a complete non
sequitur.
<Page102>
"I'm asking you if you feel any remorse about killing
me. If you did, I was thinking that I might actually
forgive you for it.
I get the feeling you aren't a very good liar for a
human."
<Page103>
"You're asking... if I feel remorse?"
"Yeah. If you say you're sorry, then I'll just consider
that the end of it."
<Page104>
...I can't believe this.
<Page105>
What's unbelievable isn't the fact that she said she'd
forgive the person who killed her, but rather―――
It's the fact that her voice sounded so incredibly
gentle.
<Page106>
"Hey. I'm asking you a serious question here, the least
you can do is answer me properly.
Come on, out with it. Do you feel sorry for what you've
done or not?
We can't move on without clearing this up first."
<Page107>
―――Do I feel sorry for what I did?
I mean the answer to that question goes without
saying――――
<Page108>
"Well... of course I―――"
Midway through my answer, something tells me to stop.
I mustn't finish that sentence.
As soon as I do, I won't be able to turn a blind eye to
this anymore.
I should just keep on looking the other way, not
acknowledge any of this, and continue to pretend to
live a normal life.
<Page109>
"Of course you... what?"
"――――――――――――――"
<Page110>
My throat clenches.
My body is filled with dread, urging me not to say it.
But―――――
<Page111>
But... I can't run away.
This is something I   run away from.
Someone who believed in me taught me that.
<Page112>
They told me what to do if I wanted to live a normal
life.
The sins that I have committed―――
The acts that I have performed―――
If there's one thing I must never do, it's to look away
from these.
<Page113>
"...Yeah, I regret it.
I've killed someone after all. There's no escaping that
fact."
<Page114>
I confess as though it's being wrung out of me.
Now that those words have left my lips, there's no
going back anymore.
With this... I've accepted that I'm worthless.
<Page115>
That's right. I killed her.
Mercilessly, for no reason at all.
I just did it for myself.
<Page116>
"...I can regret and reflect on that.
...That is, if you allow me to."
If I'm allowed to take such an easy way out.
"...I will bow as many times as you want.
...But doing so would be meaningless.
It doesn't change the fact that I killed you with my
own hands. That's why―――"
<Page117>
There's no way I can be forgiven.
I can't act like everything's fine just because she
came back to life.
I, Tohno Shiki, have murdered the woman in front of me.
I took her life――her everything――away.
A display of violence that has no equal.
<Page118>
"That's why―――you can have your revenge.
I didn't run away because I was afraid of you... I was
only running away from myself."
I keep my head down.
My penitent words aren't addressed to anyone in
particular, I'm just muttering them out loud.
<Page119>
And with that... I finally wake up.
It's as though everything that happened since yesterday
took place in a dream.
<Page120>
A fleeting dream that comes just before it all ends.
An escape from reality, where I could continue to run
from my own cowardice.
And now, at last, retribution―――
