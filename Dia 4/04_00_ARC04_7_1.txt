It doesn't seem like she's going to give up...
Or rather, if she gets any closer, it'll definitely end
in a scuffle. If that happens, I have no doubt that
she'd be the one who comes out on top.
<Page2>
"Geez, fine. Here!
You give those back the  you're done looking at
them, you hear me?"
<Page3>
I hand my glasses over to Arcueid.
She thoroughly scrutinizes them inside and out.
And then―――
<Page4>
"Shiki. Is the person who gave you these in this city?"
"I don't think so... This all happened seven years ago,
and she didn't seem like the kind of person to stay in
one place for long."
<Page5>
"―――I see. Good, I'm glad we don't have another
opponent to worry about.
Though, if we were dealing with Blue, it would be safer
to just back off."
Arcueid falls silent, a serious expression on her face.
<Page6>
"Arcueid. Are you telling me you know Sensei―――I
mean, the person who made these glasses...?"
<Page7>
"I know of her. She's one of the four extant .
These glasses are an extraordinary piece of
craftsmanship. Much as it pains me to admit it, I can't
even break them with my current strength."
Arcueid's face grows more and more serious.
<Page8>
"Wait... You were planning on breaking them?"
"―――Huh?
Did I say that out loud?"
<Page9>
"So you really were planning on breaking them..."
I snatch the glasses back from Arcueid.
<Page10>
"Geez. Weren't you the one who said I'd go insane
without these glasses?
Or are you telling me that you  me to go crazy?"
<Page11>
"No, that's not it.
I just didn't like how much you cherished them is all."
"........."
I can't understand this vampire's thought process at
all.
This woman must be trying to destroy my life, in one
way or another.
<Page12>
"Whatever... Just don't get any more crazy ideas.
The memories of the time I spent with Sensei are
precious to me, but more importantly, I wouldn't be
able to go on living without these glasses. Who knows
what would happen to my mind if I had a constant
headache from seeing those lines all the time."
