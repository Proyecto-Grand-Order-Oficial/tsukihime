"―――I see. Yeah, you're a good person, aren't you?"
"...?"
<Page2>
I look up, surprised.
The woman is smiling.
Even though she said she's a vampire, she has a very
honest face.
<Page3>
"That settles it.
I think I'll make you help me out after all."
<Page4>
"Wha―――?"
She smiles at me again, but it feels like this time
there's something meaningful behind her smile.
Help... help her...?
<Page5>
"Hey. What do you mean 'help'?"
"You know, like a    for me forgiving you.
I thought I might have you help me get rid of the
vampire that has infiltrated this city."
"――――"
Wait... I'm only getting more and more confused.
<Page6>
"Hold on, this is in exchange for your forgiveness? Are
you really going to forgive me just like that?
Also, back up for a sec―――what do you mean get rid
of the vampire? Aren't you a vampire yourself?!"
<Page7>
"Ah, no, it's not what you're thinking. I  a vampire,
but a totally different type to the one that's taken
root in this city.
You live in this city, right?
Then you must know about the recent murders."
<Page8>
"Uhh... well, yeah."
The familiar words cool down my confused mind. It's
strange, but the crazy story of the serial killings
feels way more real than the current situation.
<Page9>
"Yeah... I know about them. The serial killings right?
Quite a lot of people have already been killed, and all
the victims were found drained of their blood―――"
<Page10>
As soon as I say that, I realize what she's getting at.
So that means...
<Page11>
"Right.  the vampire I was talking about.
You keep telling me to kill you, but they're the only
person I have it out for right now.
Wouldn't you say that this serial killer is your enemy
too?"
<Page12>
"――――――"
My thoughts are racing as I try to make sense of this
new information.
I understand the context. I understand what she's
saying. But my abilities to reason through this have
just been left in the dust.
<Page13>
"Humans are honestly just sooo inefficient, I really
don't understand them at all.
You're all going around saying 'this is the work of a
vampire', but nobody is actually doing anything to
exterminate them. You're like squirrels that won't run
away even though the forest is on fire."
<Page14>
"Sure, but like, it's not as though vampires actually
 right?"
"."
The woman scowls sullenly.
Oh... right.
I remember that the person in front of me is some
unknown being who calls herself a vampire.
<Page15>
"Okay, so... now what?
You're going to get rid of the vampire behind the
murders that have been happening in this city for us?"
And... are you saying that  supposed to help you
with that?
<Page16>
"Yeah. You see, my plans have fallen apart in a big
way.
Yesterday, I was unfortunately attacked and killed by a
random murderer for whatever reason. Yeah, that really
threw a wrench in my plans. It was a perfect surprise
attack, and I was cut into seventeen pieces before I
could even try to fight back."
<Page17>
"How can one pursue a person they've only just met,
kill her, and walk away satisfied? It's so cruel that
it makes me sick. Whoever did it really is nothing more
than a cold-blooded murderer."
<Page18>
"――――"
Damn it... She's pretty clearly talking about me here.
Much as I'd like to deny it, there's nothing I can say.
<Page19>
"I'll have you know that before I finished reviving, I
really was planning on killing you.
I've never been humiliated like that before, and I had
to use up more than 80% of my energy just to
reconstruct my body."
<Page20>
"But more than anything else, it  hurt like
hell. It hurt so much that I felt I was about to go
insane, but then it hurt even more and snapped me back
to consciousness again.
Do you have any idea how it feels to be constantly
swinging back and forth between those extremes for an
entire night?"
<Page21>
"........."
I'm sorry. As a human being, this is beyond anything I
can imagine.
<Page22>
"And then, I began to hate you so much that I searched
for you.
I got so mad that I even neglected my original goal,
which was to find that vampire."
<Page23>
"It was only a couple of hours ago that I found out
from the municipal records that your clothes belonged
to that school.
I'd originally planned on waiting until night fell to
catch you, but just couldn't wait any longer. That's
why I decided to wait for you back there instead."
<Page24>
"........."
I see... so that's why she was waiting for me in front
of the school.
I'm sure that after experiencing that much pain, she
must have been dying to kill me.
But...
<Page25>
"I don't get it... If you hated me so much, why are you
willing to forgive me now?"
<Page26>
"―――I wonder.
I guess the long and short of it is that I cooled off
over time... or something.
I've also used up a bunch of my power, so I figured
that instead of mindlessly killing you, it might be
more efficient to have you be my meat shield."
<Page27>
"Hey... Didn't you just say something really awful?"
"Huh? Did I really say something like that?"
"You just said something about using people as
shields."
A particular  of shield, too.
<Page28>
"What, I mean isn't it natural that I would?
I've forgiven you, sure, but only insofar as it
concerns my own personal feelings.
You still need to atone for the murder you committed
with deeds rather than words, don't you think?"
"I mean, that's true, but..."
<Page29>
I was expecting to be killed in revenge, but becoming
someone's shield is something else entirely.
Well... I can't really put into words why they're
different, but I still have a bad feeling about it
either way.
<Page30>
"I really can't tell whether you're an honest person or
not.
In case you forgot,  were the one who killed ,
remember?
I know it may be hard to imagine, but it takes a lot of
energy to come back to life after dying."
<Page31>
"It wouldn't have mattered if you'd merely killed me.
But the way you cut me was like nothing I've ever seen
before. Since I couldn't piece my body back together
again, I had no choice but to make a new one from
scratch.
As a result, I had to use practically all of my
strength just to come back to life!"
<Page32>
The woman is so angry that she is positively fuming.
Her anger from last night, forgotten until now, seems
to have rekindled itself while she was rambling.
<Page33>
"All that to say, I'm weak right now.
I'll probably be back to normal in two days' time, but
if I get attacked before then, it's game over for me.#
That's why I'm going to have you act as my shield in
the meantime."
"No, you can't just go ahead and decide to make me your
shield!"
<Page34>
"It's your fault that I'm in this situation, so you
should at least do that much, right?
Or are you saying that you don't actually regret
anything after all?"
<Page35>
The woman stares straight into my eyes.
"..."
<Page36>
That's not fair.
Don't look at me like that before I've had the chance
to repent or say that I deserve it.
If you're going to call yourself a monster like a
vampire, at least stop condemning me with those pure
eyes.
<Page37>
"Are you serious..."
I try to steady my wavering heart.
I want to repent and atone for what I've done.
But my heart is frantically telling me that to
cooperate with this person would be    
