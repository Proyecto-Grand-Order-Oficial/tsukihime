―――I'm attacked by a headache.
It feels like tiny pins and needles are whirling around
in my eye sockets.
It's as though this red pain is trying to blot out the
scene I just witnessed.
<Page2>
"... I just wasted even more energy."
<Page3>
The woman turns back to me, her shoulders slumped in
disappointment.
It seems that she never had any real interest in the
corpses that have just vanished.
<Page4>
"This is all thanks to your dawdling.
If you had decided sooner, they never would have found
us in the first place!"
<Page5>
The woman briskly walks over to where I'm sprawled on
the floor.
The black panther has already slunk off somewhere.
Maybe it saw what she just did, decided it was no match
for her, and ran away.
<Page6>
"Hey. What... just happened?"
A headache throbs right behind my eyeballs.
The pain cutting through my skull has disrupted the
language center of my brain.
What the hell―――is this woman?
<Page7>
"Hm? You mean those things? They were just some ,
right?
They're familiars that belong to the enemy vampire.
Those ones were a bit unusual... or rather, I've never
seen that type before."
"I'm not talking about . I'm talking about ."
<Page8>
The piercing headache urges me to come to my senses.
This woman is a monster.
The black panther that sticks out like a sore thumb in
a modern city―――
Even those impossibly burning corpses―――
They both seem all but believable when compared to this
woman.
<Page9>
Creating a tornado by simply waving her arms? That's
ridiculous. A fragile human being like me can't stick
around with something that dangerous for even a second.
<Page10>
"Me? I already told you that I'm a vampire.
Wait, are you telling me that you don't know the
meaning of the word 'vampire'?
I thought it'd be common knowledge here in Japan."
<Page11>
She gives me a totally boneheaded answer.
I take this opportunity to put some strength into my
trembling limbs.
During all the commotion, she moved away from the
entrance to the alleyway.
If I run as fast as I can, I might actually be able to
escape this time.
I take a deep breath, and―――
<Page12>
"Huh...?"
"――――――"
<Page13>
Just as I'm about to make a run for it, I catch sight
of her face.
This time, I really calm down.
<Page14>
"H-Hey. What's the matter, are you hurt somewhere...?"
"Am I hurt? As if. I can't even imagine how something
that slow would be able to land a hit on me."
<Page15>
"Still... things have started to take a turn for the
worse.
Now that it's come to this, it seems I'll have to make
you my shield whether you like it or not."
<Page16>
"―――What?"
That's right, she did mention something about that
earlier...!
I thought it was only a figure of speech, but I'm not
so optimistic anymore.
This woman is seriously asking me to act as a shield
against things like that black panther and those
burning corpses...!
<Page17>
"D-Don't be ridiculous, you idiot!
You saw what just happened, what can I possibly do
against that? Wouldn't you be way better off on your
own?!"
<Page18>
"That's not true at all. As of right now, I really am
completely drained.
To use a human expression, I'm just barely hanging in
there, or something like that."
<Page19>
"――――――"
I-Is that so? It really doesn't seem that way to me,
but I guess I'll take her word for it.
I'm relieved to know that the violence from earlier is
not infinite, and that there is in fact a limit to her
actions.
Hold on, that's not what I should be thinking about
now...!
<Page20>
"Hearing you say that you're barely hanging in there
bothers me... I guess if there's anything I can
actually do to help, I'll do it.
But what can  do? I'm racking my brain, but I'm
totally out of my depth. I'm not strong enough to drive
off something like that. Sorry, but there's no way I
can be your shield."
<Page21>
"Bullshit. You were the one who killed me.
Why are you spouting these lies if you're able to pull
off something like that?"
<Page22>
"Killed you? That was―――"
That was a time when even I don't know what I was
doing.
If I can be useful, then I'll do whatever I can to
help.
But the standard of being useful here is way higher
than normal.
<Page23>
"........."
"Hmm...# Alright then, how about you just keep an eye
out for me while I'm asleep.
You should at least be able to manage that, right?"
<Page24>
I don't know how I could say no to that look...
I―――
C:> Will help...
C:> Refuse. I will never cooperate.
