"...Anyway, I'd better get up."
I still have plenty of things I need to think about,
but right now, I need to get myself out of bed.
The time is seven-thirty.
I'd normally be long finished with breakfast by this
hour.
<Page2>
"Hisui... isn't here."
She's normally standing deferentially to the side of
the room, but there's no sign of her today.
<Page3>
She must've already tried to wake me several times.
I assume that since I wouldn't wake up, she's stepping
out of the room between attempts to tend to her other
duties.
<Page4>
"I guess I wore myself out so badly that I couldn't
even wake up..."
I take a deep breath.
This time, I'll take a nap before I meet up with
Arcueid for the evening.
<Page5>
I won't think about all the strange things that
happened last night for now.
I should save that for tonight and discuss them with
Arcueid.
If I can't even live an ordinary life during the day, I
might end up doing something drastic.
<Page6>
"Right. I'll start by eating breakfast."
I may not have an appetite, but you can't start the day
on an empty stomach.
A proper breakfast should help clear up any lingering
fatigue from last night...
<Page7>
"Hu―――h?"
I lift myself out of bed, but my body just comes
crashing right back down again.
I'm like a tree being felled by a lumberjack.
I fall straight down, slamming my shoulder into the
wooden floor.
<Page8>
"――――――"
There's no strength in my limbs, I can't even get up.
On the bright side, my consciousness is a bit hazy, so
I don't feel afraid.
<Page9>
My body may be totally numb, but at least my breathing
is normal. 'Ah, my anemia again', I think to myself
indifferently.
And so, I simply lay where I fell.
I watched the hands of the clock tick by as I waited
for Hisui to call on me again, which ended up being
just past eight o'clock.
