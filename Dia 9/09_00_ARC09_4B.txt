<Page1>
...I hear the sounds of people talking.
<Page2>
"...Akiha-sama. Will you not be calling a doctor?"
"You know better than to suggest something like that,
Hisui. What good would calling a doctor do... Nii-san's
wound is hardly normal, now is it...!"
<Page3>
...Akiha and    Hisui are    talking    to each other.
This is    my room.
It seems I was    sleeping    in my    bed.
<Page4>
...I've finally regained consciousness.
I try to get up or call out to them, but my body won't
move like I want it to.
<Page5>
My chest doesn't hurt, but my body feels heavy as lead.
It seems like my eyes and mouth are the only things I
can move properly.
<Page6>
"Just what on earth were you thinking, Hisui?
You knew full well not to allow Nii-san to get anywhere
near that place...!"
<Page7>
"I have... no excuse."
<Page8>
"This isn't something that can be solved simply by
apologizing. Did I not appoint you to be his servant
specifically to prevent something like this from
happening?
How could you possibly manage to forget something so
critical...!"
<Page9>
Akiha is furious, her emotions on full display. This
sort of behavior would normally be unthinkable for her.
On the receiving end of the scolding is Hisui, who
continues to look down in shame.
<Page10>
I don't fully understand what's going on here.
Even so, I can at least tell that Hisui is being
scolded because of me.
<Page11>
"Come now. Do you not have anything to say for
yourself?
Why don't you explain to me what it is that you were
doing all day?
...Not only did you fail to report that he had
collapsed this morning, but you failed to prevent him
from entering the forest. This was clearly intentional,
wasn't it? If not, then you must be more feebleminded
than a dog.
―――Answer me, Hisui. Do you also intend on
disobeying me?"
<Page12>
Hisui doesn't answer.
The air between them grows heavier and heavier.
<Page13>
Akiha bites her lip and takes a step toward Hisui.
...It's plain even to me that Akiha is about to hit
Hisui.
Hisui continues to stare at the floor, silently
accepting what's coming to her.
<Page14>
"―――Hold on    a sec,    Akiha."
"Nii-san! You're awake?!"
"Yeah, the ruckus you were making just woke me up."
<Page15>
"Ah..."
Akiha awkwardly averts her gaze.
Hisui doesn't even look this way, she just stands there
with her head lowered.
<Page16>
"...Listen, I don't want you to be hard on Hisui.
I'm not totally up to speed, but it seems like the
cause of all this fuss is the fact that I collapsed,
right? That's hardly something you can blame Hisui for.
All that happened here was me going off and keeling
over of my own accord."
<Page17>
I put strength into my arms, and somehow manage to
heave myself at least partially upright in bed.
That simple act took everything I had in me. I don't
think I could move another muscle at this point.
But with Hisui looking this despondent right in front
of me, I need to put on a show of being healthy even if
it kills me.
<Page18>
"Geez, you shouldn't be getting into a scuffle over
someone like me anyway. You may look mature, but I
guess you're still a child after all."
<Page19>
"But―――you've been unconscious this whole time! You
were comatose for over ten hours! Nothing like that has
ever happened before. Just what would I do if you
stayed like that and never woke up, Nii-san...!"
<Page20>
"You idiot. Don't say something so ominous.
This is just the usual anemia―――#wait, what?! Did you
say that it's been ten hours?!"
"...I did. Like I said, you've been completely
unconscious since this afternoon."
<Page21>
Akiha speaks in a reserved tone.
However, I'm not worried about my body so much as I am
the promise I made with Arcueid.
<Page22>
'Tomorrow night, you'd better be here at ten o'clock
sharp.'
The look in Arcueid's eyes when she said that was more
serious than usual.
If I break that promise, who knows what sort of
unreasonable demands she'll make of me in return...!
<Page23>
"Crap, I gotta go...!
Sorry, Akiha. I'm going out, so I'll leave the rest to
you. Don't bully Hisui too much, okay?"
<Page24>
"P-Please don't say something so outrageous!
I won't ask about your nightly outings anymore. I
won't, so please, take care of yourself, at least for
tonight...!"
<Page25>
"Akiha..."
Akiha's tone has become pleading.
If she keeps worrying about me this earnestly, I won't
be able to maintain my resolve.
<Page26>
"This sort of thing happens all the time, right?
Heck, I used to collapse twice a day back in middle
school."
<Page27>
"...That's what has me so worried.
―――Nii-san. I'm begging you, please listen to what I
say, even if only for today."
<Page28>
Akiha looks at me with a serious gaze.
I'll―――――
C:> Do as she says.
C:> Go and meet with Arcueid.
