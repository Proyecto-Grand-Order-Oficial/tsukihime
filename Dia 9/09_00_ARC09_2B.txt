"...I sincerely apologize. Please punish me as you see
fit.
I did not notice that anything was amiss... I am to
blame for my oversight."
"It's not your fault. This happens all the time. It's
not that big of a deal, honest."
<Page2>
I try and talk Hisui down off the ledge while lying in
bed, the upper half of my body propped against the
headboard.
Hisui had found me collapsed on the floor when she came
back to check on the room and helped me back into bed,
where I'm now resting comfortably.
<Page3>
"Nee-san has contacted the school for us.
...I assumed that you would not be attending today in
light of your present condition, was that correct?"
"Yeah, thanks. I feel a little guilty for taking the
day off though, especially over something as minor as a
bit of accumulated fatigue."
<Page4>
"―――I believe that when you are no longer capable of
standing up, 'fatigue' is no longer the appropriate
word. You are the eldest son of the Tohno family. It'll
be a problem if you do not take better care of your
body."
<Page5>
"Hey, I am taking care of it."
Hisui scolds me, and I respond while putting on a
forced smile.
<Page6>
It's incredible just how panicked Hisui was after
finding me on the floor.
When she first opened the door, she froze in her tracks
for a few seconds.
Next, she rushed over as though to hoist me upright,
but then seized up with a strained look on her face for
another minute.
<Page7>
She then spent another few minutes pacing anxiously
around the room before finally going to call for
Kohaku-san.
In the end, Hisui never actually touched my body, but I
could still tell how devoted she was.
<Page8>
After that, I returned to the bed with Kohaku-san's
assistance, was treated to some easy-to-digest rice
porridge, and now, here we are.
<Page9>
The one silver lining in all this is that Akiha had
already left for school.
If I had collapsed thirty minutes earlier, she might
have ended up late for school as well.
<Page10>
"Anyway, thank you, Hisui.
I've had a delicious meal, and if I keep resting like
this, my anemia will clear up in no time. It's alright
if you need to get back to your duties."
<Page11>
"Understood.
However, I strongly suggest that you receive a medical
examination.
Arach-sensei happens to be present this morning,
perhaps you would like to take advantage of this
opportunity to receive a thorough physical
examination?"
<Page12>
Oh, so that eccentric doctor is here as well.
...To be honest, I don't need a medical exam, but I
don't think Hisui will leave unless I agree.
If I have to, then―――
C:> I'll have Prof. Arach take a look.
C:> I think I'd much rather Kohaku-san do it.
