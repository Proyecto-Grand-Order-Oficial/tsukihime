After pondering what to do for a bit, I decide to take
my first real stroll around the mansion in seven years.
I'll start by wandering around on the second floor.
<Page2>
The Tohno mansion consists of two wings: east and west.
To the east is the office reserved for the head of the
family, and beyond that are Akiha's private quarters.
You could consider the whole area to be her domain.
...I'm a bit hesitant to go there, so I'll stick to the
west wing today.
<Page3>
I go out into the corridor of the west wing.
The passage directly to my right leads to the lobby.
If I continue straight, the corridor will take me to
the heart of the west wing.
And of course, if I go backwards, I'll be right back in
my own room.
<Page4>
I was told that the rooms opening onto this corridor
are, for the most part, entirely vacant.
It seems like they were rented out to our relatives
back when my father was alive.
<Page5>
"If I remember correctly, that door at the end of the
hall..."
I'm pretty sure that's the room Tohno Makihisa used as
a study.

"........."
Arcueid's words from last night come to mind.
'You can't assume you're the only special one, it's
something that runs in the family―――'
<Page7>
...That's ridiculous.
It's ridiculous, but she would never say something like
that without good reason.
I'll―――
C:> ...Investigate Makihisa's study.
C:> ...Not pursue this any further.
