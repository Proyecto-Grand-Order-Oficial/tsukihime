―――White.
A color that evokes nostalgic memories.
Things that have been forgotten.
Things that shouldn't have been forgotten.
Things that my father ordered me to forget.

A hot summer day.
A blue sky with huge, towering cumulonimbus clouds.
A landscape blanketed in a shimmering haze,
and the overwhelming cries of the cicadas.
The sound of cicadas.

It's so loud that I want to die.
The husks of cicadas litter the open ground.
This space is slowly being burned away―――
As though the sun is right on top of us.
<Page4>
A hot day in the middle of summer.
As if the world had turned into a frying pan.

Akiha is crying.
Akiha, who had always meekly followed us around,
is sobbing uncontrollably.
<Page5>
A child lies crumpled in the clearing.
A deep red stain has blossomed on their white shirt.
They don't move so much as an eyebrow.
I'm gazing down at the scene before me.
My hands are red. Red like the child collapsed in a
heap on the floor.
No, that's not right.
My hands are red. Red with the blood of the living
being collapsed in a heap on the floor.
<Page6>
"■■―――――!"
The adults have arrived.
As they realize what they're looking at, the color
drains from their faces.
<Page7>
"What have you done―――――"
The adults take Akiha away.
The collapsed child remains dead.
Brilliant white clouds drift across the distant sky.
I'm left all alone, staring vacantly up into the summer
sky above.
<Page8>
"Were you the one that killed him――――"
The adults are screaming at me.
They're screaming the name of the person who killed
that child. My name.
They scream just those two syllables over and over, as
though they've lost their minds.
Just two syllables.
The adults form into a group and pin me down en masse.
Me, with my hands stained a deep red. Me, the one they
call .
<Page9>
Even now, I still don't understand it.
Killing those you can kill―――
killing those that live―――
what exactly is wrong with that―――?
<Page10>
I open my eyes.
I feel like I just saw quite a nostalgic dream. One I
couldn't fully understand.
<Page11>
"........."
I'm in my room.
After the events of last night... My memories of what
happened by the main gate are a little hazy, but it
seems like I managed to make it back to my room, one
way or another.
<Page12>
My mind obstinately refuses to work properly.
Last night's events come back to me in a jumbled mess.
Everything was so ridiculous that it's hard for me to
put my thoughts in order, but if there's one thing that
stands out, it's...
C:> Arcueid.
C:> The shadowy figure.
C:> ...Noel-sensei.
