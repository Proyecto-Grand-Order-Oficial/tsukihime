While there are no paved roads through the forest,
trails have been constructed to allow people to
navigate it on foot.
<Page2>
It's said that the Tohno residence was originally
located within this forest.
The ground the current mansion and gardens sits on used
to be nothing more than a trailhead. Apparently, it was
only thanks to the efforts of the postwar family head
that it became the way it is now.
<Page3>
I keep walking through the forest. It isn't
particularly deep, but I still can't see any end to it.
Somewhere along the way, I catch sight of a
strange-looking building.
"...Was this building always here?"
<Page4>
I wondered if that's where Hisui might be headed, but
she's currently going in the complete opposite
direction.
A building deep in the heart of the forest... Maybe
it's a temple of some sort?
<Page5>
And so.
After around ten minutes of walking, my field of vision
suddenly opens up.
<Page6>
"...It's a field."
Smack dab in the middle of the forest, the trees
inexplicably give way to a wide-open field.
Just what is this place?
I can't say I remember there being anything like this
here.
This spot is so perfectly concealed by the trees, you'd
never guess it was here from the outside... If I hadn't
followed Hisui here, it's possible I would never have
known this secluded field existed.
<Page7>
"...Has this always been here?
If so, it would have been a great place to play―――"
I don't remember ever coming here to play with Akiha,
at any rate.
―――At least... I don't... think I do...
<Page8>
"......"
After some consideration, I decide to step out into the
open.
...There isn't anything particularly special about this
field.
Hisui seems to have continued on as well, there's no
sign of her now.
<Page9>
"Huh... It really is just a big clearing."
The sun's rays are beating down much harder out here in
the middle of the field.
Even if I don't look directly up into the sky, the
sunlight is strong enough that my vision is all washed
out.
<Page10>
I can probably chalk it up to the fact that I just left
the cool shade of the forest.
It's like I've been transported to a hot summer day.
I suddenly notice that the blue sky above is filled
with huge, towering cumulonimbus clouds.
The landscape is blanketed in a shimmering haze.
The overwhelming cries of the cicadas.
The sound of cicadas.
<Page11>
"――――――Ah."
My consciousness is being burned to a crisp.
With a thud, I fall to my knees on the scorching sand.
<Page12>
I remember.
I'd forgotten all about it, but I remember now.
The blistering summer sun.
The constant cries of the cicadas.
The smell      of tears.
At my feet... The lumpen mass of what used to be a
living being, stained a deep red.
<Page13>
"――――..."
The wound on my chest hurts.
It's as if I'm being stabbed.
This pain... It feels like a kitchen knife being
plunged into my chest.
<Page14>
I killed him. <I killed him|          >. <I killed him|              >.
Stop it. <Stop it|          >. <Stop it|              >.
He's dead. <He's dead|          >. <He's dead|              >.#―――――
――――I hear a <cicada's|p e r s o n ' s    > voice in the distance.
Even though it's already the middle of autumn.
<Page15>
The shimmering summer sun dazzles my upturned eyes.
The lukewarm atmosphere makes me feel sick.
All I can see are the cast-off shells of the cicadas.
The thing at my feet is the empty shell of a cicada.
An empty shell. Someone's... empty shell.
<Page16>
"――――"
My wound opens.
A bright red stain seeps across my chest, dyeing even
my hands in a deep, glistening crimson.
<Page17>
...The silhouette of a collapsed figure.
The sound of a young girl's footsteps approaching.
The clouds high up in the sky. That blue, fleeting,
summer sky.
Without warning―――
Akiha's bloody, tear-streaked face flashes before my
eyes.
<Page18>

...Ah.
The cries of the cicadas feel like needles trying to
pierce a hole in my eardrums.
<Page19>
"――――."
What's happening? My chest hurts. I feel nauseous.
My wound closed up long ago, so why does it hurt so
much?
<Page20>
My chest      is being destroyed.
The scar opens up      and a red stain oozes out.
―――How could this be?
My wound hasn't healed at all.
<Page21>
      It hurts.
            I'm scared.
                  This must be
                        what it's like to die.
<Page22>
My consciousness fades.
My wound opens. Pus spills forth.
Consumed by the illusory summer, my mind begins to
regress.
As if my soul is slipping away.
I hear a thud as my body collapses, sprawled out upon
that grassy field.
