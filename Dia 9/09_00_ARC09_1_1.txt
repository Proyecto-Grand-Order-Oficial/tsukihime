I mean, how could she not stand out?
True to form, she had me wrapped around her finger from
the minute she staged her daylight raid on our school
to the end of our nightly patrol.
And lest we forget, there was also the incredible show
she put on for me during the fight in the apartment the
Dead had taken over.

Seven days ago I wouldn't even have been able to
imagine such a scene...
Keeping up with her just gets more demanding by the
day. It's getting to the point where I feel I ought to
tell her to rein it in a bit.

...Although...
I do have to give her credit for the fact that she
is―――in her own way―――taking care to make sure
that I don't get hurt. That, and the fact that there's
never a dull moment when she's around.
As a result, when I try to think of complaints or
grievances I have with her, I come up empty-handed.

The one thing that's bothering me is that reaction.
I'm sure she's just paying the price for being so
rambunctious even though her wounds haven't healed yet.
When I get the chance tonight, I'll try and confirm if
she really has fully recovered or not.
