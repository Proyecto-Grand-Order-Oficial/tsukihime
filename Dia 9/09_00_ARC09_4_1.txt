"........."
...I guess I don't have much of a choice.
I feel like I'll make Akiha cry if I disobey her any
more than I already have.
<Page2>
"...Alright, I'll behave. Nothing but rest for me
tonight."
So saying, I lie back down on the bed.
<Page3>
"Do you mean that...?
You're not going to sneak out of the room later,
right?"
<Page4>
"I won't. To tell you the truth, my body still feels
really heavy.
I don't think I'd even be able to make it outside
without you noticing."
"――――Thank goodness."
Akiha slumps her shoulders as she breathes a sigh of
relief.
<Page5>
"Hisui, go inform Kohaku that Nii-san has woken up.
Nii-san, what do you want to do about dinner?"
<Page6>
"...Right. Well, give my apologies to Kohaku-san, but I
don't think I can stomach eating anything right now.
I'll be better off going to sleep as-is tonight."
"...Understood. Hisui, please relay what he said to
Kohaku."
<Page7>
...Well then.
Now that I'm lying down again, I'm starting to feel a
little drowsy.
At this rate I'll be asleep in under a minute.
―――But before that...
<Page8>
"Akiha. Was there always a place like that out in the
gardens?"
"Yes. We played there all the time back when we were
children."
"I see. For some reason, I don't really remember it all
that well."
...Damn. I really did forget all about it.
<Page9>
"One more thing. This may sound like a strange
question, but...
Well... back when the two of us were kids―――do you
remember there being a third child we used to play
with?"
<Page10>
"What?"
Akiha tilts her head to the side in confusion.
...I guess that's to be expected. There's no way there
was another kid around back then.
<Page11>
But―――if there wasn't, then something doesn't add
up.
The scene I saw in my dreams.
The dream I saw in that field.
If the two of them are connected――――
<Page12>
Then for everything to make sense, there would have had
to have been another child in this house―――a child
who was murdered.
<Page13>
"You know what, never mind. I must have dreamed it."
"Is that so? Well then, good night, Nii-san.
Sleep well."
"Yeah, I will."
<Page14>
I'm out like a light the instant after I respond to
Akiha.
The emotions that usually coil themselves around my
heart as I fall asleep are nowhere to be found tonight.
...It's as though the plug was pulled on my
consciousness.
Tohno Shiki sinks into the dark abyss, as though
fleeing the events of the day.
