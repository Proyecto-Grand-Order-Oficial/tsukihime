After pondering what to do for a bit, I decide to take
my first real stroll around the mansion in seven years.
I'll start with the first floor, and the adjacent
courtyard.
<Page2>
I squint at the rays of sunlight streaming through the
skylight.
No matter how many times I see it, the Tohno mansion
lobby is always an overwhelming sight.
<Page3>
As a child, I often got in trouble for exploring the
mansion.# Back then, the mansion was like a castle to
me. I was convinced there was a hidden door somewhere
that would lead to a world full of never-before-seen
wonders.
<Page4>
Somewhere between then and now, I lost that childlike
naïveté, along with my unforgiving father.
All of that is in the past now.
<Page5>
"...This really takes me back.
Just walking down the hallway used to be enough to make
my heart race with excitement."
<Page6>
I begin to recall bits and pieces of how I used to
sneak around this lobby seven years ago.
As if beckoned by those memories, I begin leisurely
walking around the mansion.
<Page7>
I head out onto the terrace.
Strangely enough, I seem to remember the outside of the
mansion better than I do the inside.
The Tohno residence is vast.
The mansion itself is already ten times larger than the
average house, but the grounds it stands on are the
size of your average amusement park.
<Page8>
Seven years ago... I would have been ten at the time.
It must have seemed like a world brimming with
adventures to be had.
<Page9>
Each day I used to methodically walk around, carving my
name into trees or on the ground. It was part of a game
I used to play with Akiha back then, in which we would
each try and steal territory from the other.
We'd agreed that anywhere you carved your name became
your territory, so the two of us would run all over the
mansion, carving our names wherever we could.
<Page10>
Come to think of it, most of the time I spent playing
with Akiha was spent in this garden.
Unlike me, Akiha would actually abide by Makihisa's
rules, which only allowed her to play for around half
an hour of each day.
<Page11>
Though, despite that, she would still trail behind us
when we went off to have fun, quietly listening in on
what we said from a distance.
And when it came time for her to join in, she did so
with gusto, running around and competing with us for
victory in whatever it was we were up to.
<Page12>
"....
I guess the foundations of her personality were already
in place, even back then."
She must have hidden her true self under five, maybe
even six layers of disguises in front of our father.
<Page13>
Well, even with all that said, Akiha has changed a lot
since then. I failed to predict just how much could
happen over the course of seven whole years.
Time passed, and she grew up to be a fine adult.
Akiha and I are no longer the children we once were.
<Page14>
"Oh, here it is.#"
The exterior of the gazebo built in the courtyard.
Low down on the columns, in the nooks and crannies
where the sun's rays can't quite reach, you can still
see where letters have been scraped into the stone.
<Page15>
I circle around the gazebo, tallying up the crumbling
words. , , , , .
It seems like there were five matches that took place
here.
<Page16>
Just like the other spots, it seems like the win-loss
ratio here favored <me|S h i k i>.
I'll chalk that up to the fact that as a girl, Akiha
didn't have quite the same freedom to roam that was
granted to the boys.
<Page17>
"Geez. I should've just gone easy on her."
Even if I reflect on my behavior as a child, the number
of markings will not change.
I wonder how many times Akiha, who hated to lose, shed
tears of frustration as a result.
<Page18>
"...I see. Maybe the way she's acting now is her way of
settling the score."
It seems pretty unlikely, given that we're talking
about Akiha here, but on the off chance that it's true,
it would be extremely adorable.
<Page19>
"Ahh. It's like I'm the stupidest brother ever."
With a wry smile, I raise my head.
It's been fun reliving these memories, but it's about
time I returned to the―――
"Hmm...?"
...However.
High up in the rafters of the gazebo ceiling, I spot
another set of letters.
<Page20>
"...In a place like that...?"
How did someone carve it all the way up there?
There's no way a child could reach all the way up
there. I'm not even sure an adult could.
<Page21>
"What's with that. It's my name, but..."
I step into the gazebo, then climb up on the handrail
to get a closer look at the ceiling.
...It's carved in such a place that an adult would
never notice it, unless they were crawling around on
the ground and then stood up.
Hidden in the shadowy recesses of the ceiling, in small
lettering―――

"...Huh?"
What's that supposed to mean?
Watch out for your brother...?
It's not Akiha's handwriting. But then, that would mean
that I was the one who wrote this...
<Page24>
I thought I heard a noise, so I turn around.
As I do, I catch a quick glimpse of a brown and white
maid's uniform through a gap in the trees.
"Huh? Hisui...?"
She doesn't seem to have noticed me.
I see Hisui enter the forest, but have no idea what she
could be up to.
<Page25>
"Why the forest...?"
From this point on, there's nothing but trees.
I can't help but wonder what she's here to do,
considering there's nothing back there.
"......"
My curiosity piqued, I begin to follow her from a
slight distance.
