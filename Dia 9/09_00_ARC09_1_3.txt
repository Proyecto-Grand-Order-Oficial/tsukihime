Noel-sensei... no, just Noel.
If you think about it calmly, it sounds absurd.
The homeroom teacher who transferred out of nowhere...
the self-proclaimed 'beautiful teacher'... is, in
reality, a habit-wearing onee-san that came to protect
the city from vampires? There's a limit to what one can
believe.

Arcueid's introduction may have left me stunned, but
Noel's simply defies all logic.
If someone told me everything that happened last night
was a dream, I would've happily gone along with that
lie.

―――However.
All joking aside, that was no dream.
That woman is a human from the same world as Arcueid.
<Page4>
A human dedicated to killing vampires.
A human dedicated to protecting the city.
...But she's also a human whose way of speaking belies
a fundamental difference between us.
<Page5>
She almost certainly aims to eliminate vampires from
the face of the earth. I'm willing to bet that
Arcueid―――and her accomplices, such as
myself―――are no exceptions.
