<Page6>
In my dream, I watched the moon.
I don't quite remember where I was watching from or
why.
Maybe it was because——not wanting to see
anything——I'd raised my gaze to the heavens, and
there, was the moon.
<Page7>
My spine creaks.
The midwinter chill has seeped into my veins.
I feel dizzy, all alone in the dark like this.
A moon so dazzling it snatches my breath away.
...How curious#.
By all rights this cold should feel stifling, yet
instead, it feels tinged with nostalgia.
<Page8>
"―――Shiki-sama."
...I'm greeted by the morning sunshine, along with the
sound of Hisui calling out to me.
<Page9>
"―――Shiki-sama, it's time to wake up."
I'm fully awake after hearing Hisui's monotone voice.
<Page10>
"――――――"
The instant I fully open my eyes, these abhorrent
 crowd my vision.
I'm suddenly assailed by a stabbing headache. It's as
though someone shot me in the temple.
<Page11>
"Ah――――"
My consciousness, only just having woken up, loses its
footing.
I quickly reach for my glasses on the nightstand before
the dizziness takes root.
<Page12>
"Shiki-sama...? Are you not feeling well?"
"...No, I'm just still tired from yesterday. I'll be
back on my feet soon, so there's no need to worry."
<Page13>
Shaking my head lightly, I try to shed the memories of
what I'd just seen.
I'm paying the price for pushing myself to keep my
promise with Arcueid last night. My senses still feel
dull.
<Page14>
"Good morning, Hisui.
Thanks for coming to wake me up today, as always."
I heave myself upright in bed, doing my best to put on
a natural-looking smile.
<Page15>
"No, this is simply part of my job. It is not something
that is worthy of your gratitude."
"That so? But I  extremely grateful. This is a much
warmer wake-up call than the blaring of an alarm
clock."
<Page16>
Thanks to that warmth, I greet another day.
I stand up from the bed.
It's just before seven in the morning―――about ten
minutes earlier than usual.
<Page17>
"It's time for breakfast, right? I'll be there soon, so
you can go on ahead."
"Very well. In that case, I will wait for you in the
dining room."
Hisui makes her customary bow, and quietly takes her
leave...# or not?
<Page18>
"...Um, Shiki-sama?"
"Hmm? Is there something else?"
<Page19>
"...No. It's nothing.
Please take good care of your health today."
<Page20>
Hisui leaves the room.
―――Now then.
I'm certainly not in the best shape possible, but I
think I can still manage going to school.
I'm sure I'll also get some of my strength back after
eating whatever breakfast Kohaku-san has cooked up for
me.
<Page21>
In the living room, Akiha is sitting on the sofa and
Hisui is standing at attention by the wall.
<Page22>
"Good morning, Nii-san.
Did you sleep well?"
<Page23>
"A-Ah, good morning, Akiha."
As soon as I enter the living room, I can't help but
notice that Akiha seems cheerier than usual... Well,
her greeting is certainly lively, at least.
A cheery mood is good for one's mental health, so I'm
glad in that regard, but...
"What's going on? You're not wearing your school
uniform."
<Page24>
"Yes, today I requested a voluntary absence from
school. After all, something has come up at the mansion
that I must attend to.
Are you going to school as usual? Please, go and enjoy
your carefree student life to the fullest."
<Page25>
What's going on?
I get that she's in a good mood, but even so, this
feels strangely tense. Just what is she up to...
<Page26>
"Anyhow, you're looking significantly better than you
did yesterday.
It must be because you slept well last night, wouldn't
you agree?"
"I-I suppose so. I even woke up a little early today
too..."
<Page27>
". In that case, there's no need for me to worry.
I'm glad that you're the type to listen to others."
<Page28>
Her trust in me hurts#.
Last night, I ended up going out to protect my promise
with Arcueid. Even if I did manage to avoid pushing
myself too hard and make it all the way back to my room
again afterward, it doesn't change the fact that I'm
still lying to Akiha.
I feel like if I stay here any longer, I'll slip up. I
should get out of here quickly.
<Page29>
"Well, I'm going to the dining room to get some
breakfast.
I'm going straight to school after I finish eating, so
don't pay me any mind."
"Understood. However if there's anything you need,
please don't hesitate to stop by.
I'll be waiting right here, at least for a little while
longer."
<Page30>
My limbs still feel heavy, but I'll probably feel
better after breakfast.
Hiding my physical discomfort from Akiha, I head to the
dining room.
<Page31>
I finish my breakfast and leave the mansion.
It was naïve of me to think that having breakfast
would make me feel better. I've never been able to
stomach much of a meal this early in the morning.
My appetite just wasn't there today either.
Because of that, I spent a full   picking
at my breakfast―――an eternity for a student.
<Page32>
"... I sincerely apologize for failing to prepare an
appropriate meal this morning...# Tomorrow I'll be sure
to prepare a breakfast that'll make your eyes sparkle
with joy...!"
<Page33>
Kohaku-san raises both of her arms and fires herself
up.
In an unusual turn of events, Kohaku-san is the one
seeing me off this morning rather than Hisui.
It must be because there is no need to see Akiha off
today.
<Page34>
"No, it's my fault for being a light eater.
I'm sorry for always causing you trouble."
"――――――"
Kohaku-san stares at me in silence.
...I wonder why.
Her unwavering gaze reminds me of... a machine, I
guess.
<Page35>
"...Kohaku-san? Is there something on my face?"
"No, it's nothing like that.
It's just that you look a bit pale."
"――――――"
<Page36>
I feel a sense of dread.
Akiha may not have noticed anything, but am I really
looking that green around the gills...?
<Page37>
"Perhaps I should stop you from going after all.
Akiha-sama is staying home today, so why don't you take
the day off as well?"
<Page38>
"Ah... no, that's okay. My body just feels a little
heavy. I appreciate that you're concerned about me
after what happened yesterday, but I want to go to
school when I can."
<Page39>
"Geez. How can I stop you when you make such an
endearing face. I understand. I'll keep it a secret
from Akiha-sama.
But you mustn't push yourself too hard, okay?"
<Page40>
"...Alright. I'll come home early today to rest, so
please let this slide."
"Of course. I await your return."
<Page41>
With Kohaku-san sending me off with a smile, I leave
the Tohno residence.
There's a kernel of truth to what I said. I  be
making my way straight home today.
I must if I'm to regain my strength and put Akiha and
the others at ease before I go out and meet with
Arcueid.
<Page42>
I head toward the school.
I make my way down the hill. My limbs feel heavy, as
though I'm piloting someone else's body.
I thought I'd be able to shake off this sluggishness
pretty quickly, but it seems it won't be so easy.
<Page43>
         I reach the classroom.
I believe it's the middle of second period.
After the teacher         me for my tardiness, I take
my seat     .
I plop my body on the chair and finally       .
<Page44>
It's lunch break.
It seems Arihiko is taking the day off. That makes two
absentees today―――Inui Arihiko and Yumizuka Satsuki.
Arihiko is one thing, but Yumizuka's continued absence
has me a little worried.
I hope it's nothing serious, like a cold or something,
but...
<Page45>
...What am I supposed to do during my lunch break
again?
......
......
......
......Lunch.
Right, I won't be able to recover if I don't have
lunch.
<Page46>
However, my appetite is completely nonexistent.
It's not that I feel sick.
It's more like I simply lost the ability to feel
hungry.
That's why there's no need to eat. I haven't the reason
nor the strength to rise from this chair. Why waste my
energy?
It's strange. I've accepted this delusion without a
second thought.
<Page47>
The class has begun.
What class was this again? I don't remember what the
subject is for fifth period today.
<Page48>
Even when I look at the blackboard, or listen to the
teacher's voice,
none of it makes a lick of sense to me.
The letters swirl and scatter, like paint being swept
away by water.
<Page49>
"..."
I feel... nauseous.
The entire classroom is tilting.
I lose my balance.
My body starts to collapse toward that sloping floor. I
hold on for dear life. But the world offers me no
footholds.
My consciousness succumbs to the dizziness.
<Page50>
I can do nothing to catch myself as I fall out of my
chair.
An unpleasant sound echoes, hard and heavy, like a
bowling ball dropping to the floor.
The female students shriek.
I hear the footsteps of the teacher rushing over to me.
<Page51>
Ah...
Even though I'm out cold, I calmly continue to watch
the scene unfold from somewhere far away.
<Page52>
...After that, it was business as usual.
After I passed out from my anemia, I was carried to the
school infirmary and put to bed in the hopes my
condition would improve.
When seven o'clock rolled around and my fever was still
hovering near 38℃, the school nurse contacted the
Tohno household.
<Page53>
They quickly come to pick me up.
Seeing the black luxury car stop in the school parking
lot was like watching a movie play out in front of me.
The car isn't here to take Tohno Shiki to the hospital,
but back to the Tohno residence.
<Page54>
It's a reasonable thing to do, it's only# a fever after
all.
My body might be incredibly heavy, but my mind remains
perfectly clear.
<Page55>
The black luxury car stands apart from the hustle and
bustle of the world as it speeds indifferently through
the twilight city.
There is no one else in the car but me and the driver.
The driver hasn't said a single word.
Tohno Shiki is strapped to the back seat with a
seatbelt.
Both the air outside and the atmosphere inside feel
oppressively heavy.
'It feels like I'm riding in a hearse, huh.'
I think about saying that joke out loud, but decide not
to in the end.
<Page56>
The dark trees part to reveal an old mansion.
.
I let out a sigh that could be taken either as
admiration or resignation.
<Page57>
This mansion hasn't changed at all over the past seven
years.
A sturdy castle always houses a prison.
Something dreadful. Something wicked. Something that
defies common sense.
Something that must be hidden away, no matter what.
<Page58>
"Welcome back,# Shiki-sama.
I have heard the news. I will take you to your bed
soon, so please be patient until then."
<Page59>
A servant greets me in the lobby.
I'd managed to make it through the front door, but my
knees can't hold out any longer. I start to collapse
toward the carpet.
<Page60>
"Careful...!
Pardon me. Please come this way. You must still have a
fever. Please don't hesitate to lean on my shoulder."
<Page61>
The servant props up Tohno Shiki's body before it can
hit the floor. Not only that, but she offers him her
shoulder.
<Page62>
'...No, it's okay. I can still walk at least.
More importantly, thank you. You don't like being
touched, right?'
I do my best to put on a bold front.
<Page63>
"―――Yes, that is true.
However, treating you is my highest priority right now.
I won't inform Akiha-sama or my sister, so please
entrust your body to me.
It's not your fault that you are prone to illness. It's
alright for you to need a helping hand.
After all, we humans are creatures that want to rely on
others and to be relied upon in turn."
<Page64>
After saying that, the servant grasps my cold hands.
<Page65>
'...I see. In that case, I leave it to you.'
I obediently surrender to her sweet-sounding voice.
<Page66>
...I want to be relied on. I want to rely on others.
...I want to be protected. I want to protect others.
...I want to live. I want to let live.
<Page67>
I see.
Although they are the opposites of each other, that
doesn't mean they are mutually exclusive.
We all harbor each of these opposing desires within us,
after all.
<Page68>
"We're going up the stairs, so please watch your step."
The servant leading me by the hand begins to climb the
stairs.
...Simply walking is enough to make my vision flicker
in and out.
In my dazed state, all I can do is put one foot in
front of the other, relying on the servant for the
rest.
<Page69>
'――――Huh?'
This is the wrong place. We went the wrong direction.
This corridor leads to the east wing. It is an area
that Tohno Shiki must not enter.
Beyond this point,
beyond this point―――
<Page70>
'Hey, we went the wrong way.'
Tohno Shiki calls out.
There's no response from the servant.
No, that's not all―――I no longer feel the sweet
touch of her hands, nor is there any sign of the maid
outfit I'm so used to seeing.
<Page71>
'...Huh...'
I gather what I can of my unsteady consciousness and
examine my surroundings.
There is no one in the corridor.
I don't hear a single sound.
I can't feel anything at all.
I suddenly realize...
<Page72>
This space is an enormous drawer.
A place to put away junk that no longer serves a
purpose.
A place with no way in, or out.
<Page73>
"Ah―――"
I crumble to the ground.
It seems that someone can no longer stand to let Tohno
Shiki live.
I wonder if the ground is like a soft cushion,
or like a hard tatami mat made of woven grass.
I've lost all sense of touch, so the truth will
probably have to wait until the next time I wake up.
<Page74>
An end without any explanation.
A vague conclusion with unanswered questions.
As sudden as it may be, an end like this is fitting for
someone like Tohno Shiki.
