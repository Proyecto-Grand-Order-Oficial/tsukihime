I guess I'll start by leading her toward the station at
the heart of Souya.
"Going on a trip, going on a trip ♪"
Arcueid is bounding ahead, down the hill.
She's like an excited kid, running an errand for the
first time.
<Page2>
"Shiki, I noticed you've got a different outfit on
today.
What happened to those black clothes you always wear?"
"What do you mean 'always wear'..."
<Page3>
...Oh, I get it. She must have drawn a line from
'Daytime Shiki' → 'School uniform' in that brain of
hers.
Also, our uniform is , not black. I wish
she'd stop casting shade on people's character every
chance she gets.
<Page4>
"Come on, do you really think I'd go wandering around
in my school uniform in the middle of the day?
I mean, today's a special occasion since we're on a
dat―――since we're going to be exploring the city in
a new light, right? That's why I'm wearing something a
little more refined than usual."
Well, by refined I mean I'm wearing leather shoes
instead of sneakers, but it's better than nothing.
<Page5>
"――――――I see. 'Special', huh."
"Hm?"
Something must have occurred to her, as she stops dead
in her tracks.
<Page6>
"Shiki. Stop right there, turn around, and close your
eyes.
Hmm, yeah. Ten seconds, no, three seconds should be
enough."
<Page7>
"You mean you want me to face the other direction?"
Her request was so casual that I found myself obeying
without really thinking about it.
<Page8>
I turn around and close my eyes.
Standing like this, my brain has a chance to catch up
and I ask myself what the hell I'm even doing.
", just you watch. I'm not gonna be outdone!"
"Huh?"
<Page9>
Outdone? Outdone at what?
...What was that? I think I just felt a strange breeze
coming from behind me!
<Page10>
"Hey, what are you trying―――# to#―――#"
I stop mid-sentence... no, it's more like the thought
itself was cut short.
<Page11>
"What do you think? We won't be fighting during the
day, so I thought it wouldn't be a problem to wear
something like this."
<Page12>
"――――――"
...Oh no.
Who is this person... Who  this person. Who is this
person!?
What's with that casual wear? That fur? That ribbon?
How did she spontaneously change like that? Come to
think of it, where  she even get her clothes from?
Even though nothing about her outfit is overly
extravagant, this spectacular metamorphosis suits her
so well that none of those questions even matter.
<Page13>
"Hey. Do I look different than usual? Am I cute?"
"―――Y-Yeah―――"
There was no need to ask that! Yo-You, you, you―――!
<Page14>
Wait a second.
Cute? This isn't simply a matter of cuteness.
What I've just witnessed defies comprehension. It's
beyond all reason.
Are you trying to tell me that vampires come fully
equipped with date outfits built-in?
Knowing you has meant a constant stream of surprises,
but you still had further to go, huh? What are you, a
gravure idol? An adorable anthropomorphic rabbit? To be
honest, I really just want to take a picture right now.
You're a creature who only knows how to play dirty!
<Page15>
". I can't tell whether it's good or bad if you
stay quiet!
Today's a special day, so something like this should be
fine, right?"
<Page16>
"Good or bad? Arcueid―――"
Of course it's bad. I cannot allow her to violate my
heart like that. I want to reject this evil on behalf
of all of humanity.
But... is there a single human being on earth that
could reject the Arcueid in front of me?
<Page17>
"...!"
I grit my teeth and control my urge to surrender.
I gather up every bit of pride inside my body, and
then...
"―――Well, I see no... issues with your...
appearance."
I reply to Arcueid while maintaining my dignity as a
human being.
<Page18>
...I may have been dealt some damage by this sudden
turn of events, but I still have the home field
advantage.
It's okay. There's no reason to panic.
I just need to pull myself together and take Arcueid by
the reins, same as I always have.
<Page19>
"...Okay.
Arcueid, do you have anywhere in particular you want to
go?"
<Page20>
"Hmm, I don't know, so I'll let you decide.
Take me somewhere appropriate."
"........."
<Page21>
She responds with a carefree but highly challenging
request―――
on the level of responding 'Anything's fine' when asked
what you want for dinner...
I have no idea what kind of place she would enjoy, but
I need to think of something before we arrive at the
station.
<Page22>
Luckily, the contents of my wallet have left me with
some financial freedom.
The best place to take her has to be―――
C:> The movie theater, even if it  a little cliché.
C:> That gloomy back alley, of course.
C:> The park. Today's weather is perfect for a stroll.
