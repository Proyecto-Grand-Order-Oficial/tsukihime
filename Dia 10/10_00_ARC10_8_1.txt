I'm simply a beast that wants her.
<Page2>
This beautiful creature―――
This disgusting organism―――
This maddening feeling...
Just like that time―――
I am a brute who wants only to trample her―――
with everything I've accumulated in this body.
<Page3>
The me that cares about the woman takes a back seat.
"―――."
<Page4>
The fever dormant in my blood awakens.
An aneurysm that blocks off all reason.
"―――."
<Page5>
If its form is human, then human logic applies.
Break. Twist. Split. Untie.
Remove. Peel. Divide. Tear.
There is no end. There is no limit. I cannot stop.
Even when I kill her, I really can't get enough of
this...
"―――."
<Page6>
I finally remembered.
I was this sort of creature from the beginning.
The stage just hadn't been set well enough for me.
Acting automatically, or perhaps out of some biological
imperative, over and over again...
"―――[ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00]―――!"
Until dawn breaks after <Seven Nights|N a n a t s u - Y o r u      >, I'll forget
everything about being human.
<Page7>
"――――――#."#I rise up# from the sea of blood.
It must have been a truly spectacular lifeform.
Even though I dismembered only a single creature, the
back alley brims with blood and organs.
The color is so pervasive that it hurts my eyes. It's
so sticky that it's hard to walk. It reeks of flesh. It
smells like blood.
<Page8>
"――――――"
My headache ceases.
I've made a mess of my own credibility too.
Even if I turned heel and headed home, I've long since
lost a place to return to.
<Page9>
"―――Ah, it's you."
Come to think of it, we first ran into each other here
in this back alley.
Maybe it's coincidence, maybe it's fate.
Human life is such a wonderful thing.
<Page10>
The fangs of the beast take aim at my throat.
I hear the sound of squirming flesh behind me.
Talk about being between a rock and a hard place.
I suppose the aberration reviving behind me was never
something that could be defeated by human hands after
all.
<Page11>
"―――Man. That was sloppy of me, really."
I shrug at my shameful display, and offer up my throat.
A tremendous sound runs through me on impact.
The phenomenon is called bone conduction. The sound of
my flesh and cervical vertebrae being ground to a pulp
reverberates around my narrow skull.
<Page12>
"――――――"
I try to leave some words in my final moments, but
without a neck, I am unable to speak.
What did I long for?
What did I hold dear?
What was I afraid of?
These questions are meaningless to a brute like me.
<Page13>
From the very beginning, I was a fool who forgot about
everything.
It was a near-instantaneous death, so I didn't have to
experience the much worse fate awaiting me.
I have no regrets.
...Although I would have liked to at least give my
thanks to that black panther-chan for coming all this
way to finish me off.
