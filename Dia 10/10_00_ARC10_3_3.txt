It's a lovely day out today, so I decide to take her to
the park.
Once we've had a relaxing stroll around there, maybe we
can head over toward the station.
<Page2>
We enter the park.
Even on a weekday morning, the park is teeming with
people. Businessmen in suits, women and their children,
a handful of slightly older couples... All sorts of
people are out here leisurely enjoying the day.
<Page3>
"Hmm. This place really fills up during the day. Even
though we've already been here together so many times,
it feels totally different."
<Page4>
Arcueid's excitement has cooled off a little, but it
seems like she's still enjoying herself.
I guess she doesn't have any objections to the idea of
simply taking a walk around the park.
<Page5>
"Ah, there's a shop open over there.
Shiki, what kind of shop is that?"
<Page6>
Arcueid points toward the store with great interest.
On the road leading away from the fountain, there is a
van selling ice cream.
<Page7>
"That's an out-of-season ice cream van. Cold things are
bad for your body, so just bear with it for now."
<Page8>
I preemptively forbid the greedy Arcueid from pursuing
it.
Eating ice cream under the autumn sky doesn't sound
half bad, but it seems like today is going to be a long
day. As such, I should avoid putting something cold in
my stomach.
<Page9>
―――But why do I feel this sense of unease?
We're just wandering about, so why do I have the eerie
feeling that I'm being watched?
<Page10>
"Hey Shiki, do you know any of the people here?"
"No, I only know one person who would skip school to
goof off during the day. Why?"
<Page11>
"Well, everyone is staring at us, so I thought that you
might know them."
"...I see. So that's what had me feeling so uneasy."
<Page12>
I get it now.
I was too preoccupied with finding a spot to sit down
that has a nice view, isn't too crowded, and is ideally
in the shade, to realize that we're being ogled from
all directions.
Needless to say, they aren't looking at  so much as
they're looking at .
<Page13>
Arcueid is both my collaborator and a vampire.
...As such, I've done my best not to be too conscious
of it, but there's no hiding the fact that she's an
extraordinarily beautiful woman.
<Page14>
It makes total sense that Arcueid would turn heads just
by walking around the park.
Not only that, but there also seem to be a few men
waiting for the right time to make a pass at her.
<Page15>
"Arcueid, let's head somewhere else."
<Page16>
I move closer to Arcueid as if to shield her from the
gaze of those around us, take her by the hand, and
firmly shepherd her deeper into the park.
<Page17>
Unlike the plaza around the fountain, our normal
rendezvous spot is devoid of people.
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little disappointed
that this is where we ended up, but at least it beats
where we were before.
<Page18>
"Let's kill some time here for a bit. If you want
something to drink, I'm buying. Any requests?"
<Page19>
I let go of Arcueid's hand and turn to face her.
<Page20>
"...Ah, yeah.
Let me see... Can I just have some water?"
"You got it. Go ahead and sit down on the bench for
now.
...Also, if those guys try to chat you up, please
ignore them. Don't even give them the time of day."
<Page21>
I jog over to a nearby vending machine.
...Okay, fine.
It would be dull to just get water. I wonder if that
ice cream van is still there...
<Page22>
Even after morning gave way to afternoon, we didn't
move from our spot in the park.
I floated the idea of heading over to the station, but
Arcueid proposed that we remain here and take in the
surroundings a while longer.
<Page23>
From her bench on the outskirts, Arcueid observes the
entire park.
Pigeons strut in formation down the road.
As lunchtime arrives, the number of businesspeople in
suits multiplies.
The tally of students in my age range goes up as well.
There seem to be more children around too, all of them
innocently running around after their accompanying
mothers.
<Page24>
"........."
Arcueid stares at the picturesque view of the
park-goers.
<Page25>
The face I see in profile doesn't carry her usual
carefree, innocent expression.
Nor does it exhibit the cool indifference she displays
when confronting a Dead Apostle.
<Page26>
"Can I ask you something weird?"
"Hm? I dunno if you've ever asked me something that
wasn't weird. What's up?"
<Page27>
"I guess it's because you're the type that loves weird
questions.
...Well, not that there's anything wrong with that."
It's not like I'd be here with her in the first place
if I wasn't a little weird myself.
<Page28>
"You said before that you don't care about human
beings, but is that  true?
I mean, it's not like you hate them, right?"
Whether or not she  them is a different question
entirely.
<Page29>
"So it really was another weird question.
―――But what makes you think that?"
<Page30>
What makes me think that?
Because there's no way a person making a face like that
could hate humans.
<Page31>
"Oh, just a hunch.
I'm not necessarily saying that it'd be great if you
did, or that if you do, I'm going to start putting you
to work helping more people, alright?
I know full well you're not so kindhearted. Not to
mention the fact you'd probably leave a trail of
destruction in your wake if you tried."
<Page32>
"How rude! I can be nice too!
It's just that I get a little carried away sometimes!"
<Page33>
Right.
She wouldn't be Arcueid if she weren't as lively as she
is right now.
I should simply forget about the thoughts I'd been
entertaining earlier.
<Page34>
However, the conversation cuts off there.
It's not like I spoiled the mood, or that things became
uncomfortable.
I just got the sense that she wanted to spend some time
in silence, so I simply took the hint.
<Page35>
"...Hey, Shiki."
"Hm? Are you bored of staring at the wall? Then we
should go back to the city and get something to eat."
"No, it isn't anything like that... I was just
wondering what that was about earlier."
"...Hm?"
From earlier? So it's not about my weird line of
questioning?
<Page36>
"I don't understand. What do you mean by earlier?"
"I'm talking about when you held my hand.
You've touched me a number of times before, but each
time you did you had a reason, right? But there wasn't
a reason to earlier, and it's got me wondering what was
behind it."
<Page37>
"You ask what was behind it, but―――"
The real reason isn't something I want to say out loud.
"There was no particular reason."
It was a feeling that I wanted to keep hidden.
<Page38>
"...It just kind of happened.
It's fine, right? Holding hands isn't a big deal at
this point. Humans do spontaneous stuff like that
fairly frequently, you know."
<Page39>
"I see. If you often do things for no reason, then you
must do a lot of pointless things, huh?"
<Page40>
"I have to say I object to the assertion that just
because something is spur of the moment means it's
automatically pointless.
If anything, it means there's one fewer step between
idea and execution, right? That's  efficient if you
ask me. ...Granted, it's still a toss-up whether the
result ends up being good or not."
<Page41>
"I see."
With a soft murmur of either admiration or
astonishment, Arcueid turns her attention back toward
the fountain.
<Page42>
"Hey, Shiki. This is completely unrelated, but did you
use to be like that too?"
<Page43>
Abruptly switching gears, she hits me with a new
question out of nowhere.
She's watching some children playing around in front of
her, so presumably that's what she's asking about.
<Page44>
"Hmm, hard to say. It's definitely true that I played
around a lot as a kid, but only ever within the
confines of the mansion. I didn't get many chances to
play around in a park like this."
<Page45>
In terms of playmates, I only had Akiha and the others;
I never played around with people I didn't know like
these kids are doing.
If I had to give an answer, I would say that I'm
probably a child who grew up in a sterile environment.
<Page46>
"But what about you, Arcueid?
...You don't have to answer if you don't want to."
If vampires don't have anything resembling a childhood,
then it would be rude of me to ask her such a question.
<Page47>
"It's just as you suspect, I don't have any memories of
my childhood.
We spend our vulnerable years sleeping, only venturing
out during the period when we're already in our
prime―――as I am now.
That's why I thought it was a bit strange.
Childhood, senescence... I couldn't help but wonder how
you people make it through those meaningless years."
<Page48>
It felt like she directed those words more at herself
than toward me.
<Page49>
"It's nothing. This is the first time I've ever
aimlessly whiled away the hours like this, so my
thoughts must have gotten a little mixed up."
Saying that, Arcueid gets up from the bench.
<Page50>
"Now then, let's go to the station!
There's nothing interesting to see here, after all!"
"There isn't?!"
I blurt out a response before I can stop myself.
<Page51>
"...You idiot. If it was that uninteresting, then you
could have just said so. I was sure that..."
<Page52>
"Hm? It's uninteresting, but it felt good, you know?
I thought it would be nice to do something like this
again, didn't you think so too?"
"―――Well, that's..."
<Page53>
It's true that it was uninteresting, but it wasn't
exactly boring either.
Now that I think about it, I don't often get a chance
to idly spend time in the park with Arcueid.
<Page54>
"...I guess so. It's not bad to do something like this
once in a while.
But anyway, let's have lunch. I haven't had anything
since I woke up, so I'm starving."
After I say that, we start heading out of the park.
<Page55>
"Hmm―――――"
For a brief moment, I thought about holding her hand,
but I quickly decided against it.
I'm glad that I had no reason last time.
I'm glad that I wasn't aware of my own feelings.
But if I were to touch Arcueid for a reason―――if I
were to  to―――it would not end well for Tohno
Shiki.
