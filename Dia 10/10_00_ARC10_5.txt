Having finished our meal and had our fill of window
shopping along the main street, we're now on our way to
my school.
It's already sunset.
I'm not sure what Arcueid had in mind when she
said―――
<Page2>
'I want to visit the school that you go to!'
But that devilish smile of hers steamrolled any
resistance I might have mustered.
<Page3>
It's five o'clock.
There's virtually no signs of life at the main gate, no
doubt thanks to the official notice stating that all
club activities are suspended and students are to
return home promptly.
If there were any people lingering around, I would
probably be able to count them on one hand. As long as
we don't do anything to attract attention, I should be
able to at least show her around the courtyard.
<Page4>
"Just so we're clear, I'm not taking you inside the
school building. I spent the whole day playing truant,
and you don't even go here."
<Page5>
"I know, I know. I won't cause any trouble, so relax."
Arcueid stands by the front gate and furtively peers
around at the grounds.
Having a blonde beauty hovering around the front gate
like this is sure to attract attention.
<Page6>
"Arcueid, this way. Let's head to the courtyard."
I grab her by the hand and rush inside.
<Page7>
The courtyard is completely silent.
...Come to think of it, she's been here before.
I felt like I was going to have a heart attack at the
time, but looking back on it now, I can't help but
smile.
A vampire out and about during the day is hard enough
to believe as it is, but one wandering around my school
just makes a mockery of common sense.
<Page8>
"Hey. Did you notice, Shiki?"
"Did I notice what?"
"The school... As far as I can tell, there's nobody
else here."
"What did you say...?"
<Page9>
Hearing that, I peer into the school from the
courtyard.
It's no surprise that the classroom lights are off, but
I'd expected the staffroom to still be packed with
teachers at this hour. Instead, it too is dark and
empty.
<Page10>
It's just as Arcueid said: there really isn't anyone
here but us.
...The front gate was open, but maybe we missed the
last of the staff members filtering out while we were
on our way to the courtyard.
<Page11>
"Hey, Shiki. There's nobody inside, you know?#"
Arcueid stares at me with puppy dog eyes... I think I
know where this is going.
<Page12>
"Absolutely not."
I try and put my foot down, but she isn't even
listening to me.
<Page13>
"If there's nobody here, who's going to get mad at us
for going inside?
, we came at just the right time, didn't we?"
"I'm telling you, I  don't want to do this."
<Page14>
"Wow, the inside is a lot bigger than I expected.
Even the corridors are wide. There's so much room for
activities!"
...That's strange.
Arcueid's voice doesn't sound like it's coming from
nearby, but from over by the windows into the school.
<Page15>
"Shiki!
This door won't open, but it's fine if I break it,
right?"
<Page16>
She isn't even waiting to hear what I have to say.
Arcueid is winding back her fist in front of the
windowpane. Seeing her make the universal motion for
'I'm gonna hit ya☆' brings my dizziness rushing back.
<Page17>
"You... little...! Why don't you ever listen to what
people say!"
There's no way I can let that agent of chaos loose in
our school building.
Even if it's impossible to stop her, I need to at least
try...!
<Page18>
"Ah, you came."
I don't know what she finds so amusing, but she's
grinning from ear to ear.
<Page19>
"...Arcueid. What exactly is so fun about looking
around my school?
If you're just looking for a place to mess around,
there are better options out there. I'll take you
somewhere nice, so let's get out of here."
"But this isn't bad, right?
Seeing the place that you always go to is fun in
itself."
<Page20>
"Shiki, I want to have a look around inside.
Won't you kill the lock on the window for me?"
"Will I kill the lock for you? Arcueid―――"
<Page21>
"You'd do a cleaner job of it than I would, right? You
can cut things in a way no other blade can. Even if
someone does discover it later, they'll just write it
off as something they can't explain."
Arcueid excitedly waves me over to one of the windows
that opens onto the corridor.
<Page22>
"...Geez, you really are acting like a child."
Against my better judgment, I lower my glasses slightly
and take a look.
...There's a line running right across the latch
securing the window...
<Page23>
"...Damn it. Isn't that just convenient."
I take out the knife from my pocket and slice open the
latch.
...Well, perhaps it's more correct to call it 'killing'
rather than slicing it open.
<Page24>
"Okay. We can enter through here."
I open the window and enter the school building without
taking off my shoes.
<Page25>
"......."
Maybe I guessed well, or maybe it's just too familiar
of a trope.
The very first place that Arcueid wanted to go was my
classroom on the third floor.
<Page26>
"What do you usually learn in here?"
"What do I learn? Just the usual things that a student
normally learns.
We study history in order to broaden our understanding
of our own culture. We also deepen our understanding of
how things work through physics and mathematics. Ah,
and we're also taught English in case we need to travel
abroad."
<Page27>
"I see. Since it was you, I thought they would teach
you how to efficiently dissect a human body or how to
handle a blade."
Arcueid offhandedly says something rather amusing.
<Page28>
"...Arcueid. You know full well what kind of place this
is, don't you?"
", correct!"
Arcueid claps her hands together in applause.
<Page29>
...It's always hard to understand what's going on
inside her head, but this time I'm more stumped than
usual.
This school has nothing to do with slaying vampires, so
what is she trying to achieve by coming here?
<Page30>
"Shiki.#"
"What is it? You look serious all of a sudden.
Did you have a reason for bringing me here after all?"
<Page31>
"No, I didn't have any good reason for coming here.
I just wanted to ask you what goes on in here."
"What goes on in here... you mean at school?"
<Page32>
"Yeah. You spend half of your day in this place, right?
Have you ever used any of the knowledge or experience
you've built up here?
Don't you ever think it's a waste of time to learn
stuff you don't need to survive?"
"Huh―――?"
Out of all the questions she's asked so far, this one's
the most difficult to grasp.
<Page33>
"You might never apply some of the knowledge or skills
you learn here even once in your entire life, right?
Don't you think that's pointless?"
<Page34>
"...Well, it's true that a lot of it is probably
useless.
For example, I'm studying mathematics, but if I don't
end up in a profession that relies on it, then I won't
really need it again. If I just wanted to get by, I'd
be fine only knowing basic arithmetic.
Even if I were to learn English or the history of my
country, there's no guarantee that it'd come in handy
later. It's as you say, the majority of what I learn
here isn't really necessary for day-to-day life."
<Page35>
"Huh, so you're# fully aware.
If that's the case... why do you continue to do such
pointless things?
Your lives are so short that I wouldn't have thought
you'd have time to spare for things like this."
<Page36>
"Time to spare? ...Well, it's not like I have a clear
purpose in life yet. I may as well while away my time
like this until I do."
<Page37>
"I can't believe it. You voluntarily endure this
bondage, day after day, even knowing full well how
pointless it is.
...Yeah, I can't believe this at all."
<Page38>
Arcueid has begun sounding severely depressed.
...I can't say I have any real clue as to why.
However, I can at least respond to her soliloquy.
<Page39>
"Daily bondage, huh. I guess you could see it that way.
But is it really so bad to do something pointless?"
"――――Huh?"
<Page40>
"It's fine, right? To waste time, that is#.
Even if what we learn can only be used here, it will
still serve as a reminder of days gone by.
There will come a time when we're old and have nothing
left to do but reflect.
These days are for us to look back on with a bitter
smile as we remember how things used to be. That has
meaning in and of itself, you know."
<Page41>
"...Even though the contents of those memories are
pointless, are you saying that you'd enjoy thinking
back on them?"
<Page42>
"Yeah, that's exactly it. Humans are conveniently built
to remember the past through rose-tinted glasses, we
simply forget all the inconveniences.
If you hold the view that life is full of pointless
things, you might end up reasoning your way to the
conclusion that life itself is meaningless... right? On
the contrary, I think that all these useless things are
what people really live for.
That's why I'm not too hung up on it. I believe that
deceiving yourself over and over again, trying to stave
off the understanding of how meaningless it all is, is
just part of existing."
<Page43>
"So you recognize that it's pointless and then choose
to live with it.
...I can't do things that feel pointless. Even up to
now, I've never done anything that wasn't necessary."
<Page44>
"What are you talking about? You could say that
everything we've done today is pointless, couldn't you?
Your objective is to find vampires, right?
If so, then there's no need to walk around the city
with me."
<Page45>
"...I guess you're right. I don't really understand why
I did that myself.
I tried to get you to explain it to me as someone used
to being useless, but only ended up more confused."
<Page46>
"Yeah, yeah, the fault is all mine. I'm just a human
who can't escape futility. I can't even give a good
reason for my continued existence."
"...Ah―――right."
<Page47>
"I'm sorry. I know what you're trying to say.
Humans as a species aren't evaluated as individuals,
but as part of a group.
That's why if one is wrong, it is tolerated as long as
the entire group is correct. You can all flourish as
one, and together bring forth a single answer when the
time comes that your species must face its fate."
<Page48>
"...But since  are only individuals, we cannot allow
ourselves to be wrong, no matter what.
I can never allow another person's will to influence
me.
That's why―――I've always been taught never to do
anything unnecessary."
<Page49>
...Arcueid's voice is subdued.
She pieces her words together as if she were confessing
a sin.
<Page50>
"―――But then I became confused.
In such a short period. In just a meager seven days.
...I wondered if what I was doing was right. I mean, I
had so much fun. Up until now, I never thought I could
be so happy from just being like this... from just
existing."
<Page51>
"...I wonder if I'm broken somehow.
After all, I've never been awake for this long
before―――
Sometimes I wonder if I've already fallen asleep, and
this is all just a selfish dream of mine."
<Page52>
"―――――"
I'm at a loss for words.
What she's describing now is something I truly cannot
comprehend.
I cannot hope to fathom even a fraction of the feelings
that are tormenting Arcueid. All I can understand is
that I can't bear to see her like this.
<Page53>
"...What do you mean broken? You look just fine."
<Page54>
"I might appear that way, but that's not how I feel
inside.
All these unnecessary emotions, both happy and sad,
have become so much stronger. If I can no longer ignore
things that I could before, wouldn't you consider that
being broken?
And besides, I'm not normal. I'm not like you. I'm a
vampire..."
<Page55>
It almost looked like Arcueid was laughing forlornly.
It was fleeting, obscured by the red glow of the
sunset.
<Page56>
"―――――――Th-"
But it's strange.
That doesn't feel right.
The classroom at sunset.
A woman looking down helplessly, bathed in the red glow
of the sun.
To think that such a thing could exist before my eyes.
<Page57>
"That's not―――like you."
Yeah. It really isn't.
You're a vampire―――so don't show me this side of
you. The side of you that's as helpless as any ordinary
girl.
<Page58>
"Don't worry about whether you can ignore it or not, or
whether something's pointless. Just forget about all
that.
It's not good to think so seriously about yourself. I
don't know what exactly is bothering you, but you're
fine the way you are.
I mean, it's not as though you're bothering anyone."
<Page59>
"...Is that so?
You've yelled at me plenty of times, though. Is that
different?"
<Page60>
"You idiot, I'm an exception.  committed the sin of
murdering , so having you drag me around like this
is what I deserve.
...That's why it's fine. I'm doing this because I enjoy
it, so please don't go thinking that this bothers me."
"........."
<Page61>
Arcueid's eyes remain dark.
...I'll really be in trouble if she keeps making that
face.
She looks so frail. I won't be able to stop myself from
embracing her at this rate.
<Page62>
"...I'm begging you, keep your head up, Arcueid.
Sure, you're selfish, act rashly, and cause me no end
of trouble, but apart from that, you're decent. There's
nothing broken about you, you're no different from any
other girl.
So come on, let me see that smile of yours again. If
you keep looking at me like that, I'll start feeling
bad as well."
<Page63>
"...That was a terrible thing to say. Am I really that
selfish?"
Arcueid mutters her response slowly, as if gauging my
reaction.
Not good. I got a little caught off guard.
Was this princess seriously unaware of her own
selfishness up until this point?
<Page64>
"You idiot, what are you talking about?!
If you took 'selfish' out of 'Arcueid', you'd be left
with nothing but bones! Bones!"
<Page65>
I try to be light-hearted and poke fun at her, but end
up bursting out in laughter.
I mean, never in my wildest dreams would I have
imagined Arcueid sheepishly asking me questions about
herself.
<Page66>
"Mmm......!"
Ah,# she's mad.
<Page67>
"You dummy! We were having a serious discussion here,
how can you be such a meanie?!"
"Well, that's how I am. Didn't I say that I'm nice to
everyone else but you? It's not like I've only started
being mean to you now."
<Page68>
I give her a wry smile, as though inviting her to try
and deny what I just said.
No objections from her side. The cloud that had been
hanging over her head earlier is now nowhere to be
seen, and her face is back to her usual genuine self.
<Page69>
"...Yeah. As I thought, you're not you when you're not
lively. I'm a little relieved too."
"Huh...? W-Why are you feeling relieved?
You said that you act mean toward me, right?"
"―――Well, I mean, that's true, but..."
<Page70>
It's like it's fine no matter how much she drags me
around, or how much trouble she brings along with her.
I simply couldn't stand to see her so depressed―――
<Page71>
"........."
Hold on. If I continue this train of thought, it won't
end well.
It's true that she's pretty and that she really is a
good person. I also believe that there's never a dull
moment with her around.
<Page72>
...But that's all there is to it.
I mustn't develop any more feelings than this.
Get a hold of yourself, Shiki. No matter how lovely she
may be,# she's still a vampire in the end―――
<Page73>
"Geez, you really are indecisive.
Do you not even know what you yourself are thinking?"
<Page74>
"I don't want to hear that coming from a vampire who's
been whining like you have.
It's fine if I don't know myself. I'm well aware of how
weird I am. It's true that my memory is always hazy and
that I get anemic all the time. I basically can't even
take care of myself."
<Page75>
"I see. So that's why you're always in a daze."
Arcueid nods to herself, as if the final piece of some
great puzzle had finally slid into place.
<Page76>
"........."
I'm too preoccupied with wondering whether she
seriously believes that makeshift excuse to actually
get mad at her.
...I guess Akiha also scolds me for zoning out all the
time. I must just project unreliability or something.
