―――I can't.
I can't do anything that would make Arcueid cry again.
<Page2>
The first time I was struck with this nightmare of a
headache, I ended up killing her.
There will not be a second time.
Even if my brain burns out, I will never allow myself
to defile Arcueid―――
<Page3>
"――――."
I move away from Arcueid.
My headache also disappears, and my heart returns to
normal.
The savage emotions I felt are gone, and I finally come
to realize what I've done.
<Page4>
"―――How―――could, I..."
I can't believe it myself.
But the memories remain etched in my mind.
Pushing down Arcueid.
Crushing her neck as I prepared to impale her with my
knife.
...And desiring her skin like a beast.
<Page5>
"―――――"
I have no words.
Arcueid straightens her clothes and stands up.
How―――can I apologize to her?
This is not something that can be forgiven with a mere
'I'm sorry'.
<Page6>
"―――Arcueid, I――――"
"Don't worry about it... I'm the one who should be
apologizing."
<Page7>
No. I'm the one who's in the wrong.
So what if I have chronic anemia? So what if I get so
dizzy I pass out?
Neither of those can justify any of this.
―――If I had been more careful, none of this would
have ever happened.
<Page8>
"You looked into my Mystic Eyes. There's no way you
could have held back.
I mentioned before that vampires have the Mystic Eyes
of Enchantment. A curse that captivates those who look
into them, regardless of how they may feel about me. So
it's not your fault. The sexual desire that you felt
toward me is also a part of that.
...Even though you have the Mystic Eyes of Death
Perception, you're still a human in the end."
<Page9>
Arcueid coldly asserts that it was all because of a
curse.
...But, she's wrong.
It's true that I went crazy after looking into that
golden eye.
But it was nothing more than a catalyst.
At that time, I truly felt from the bottom of my heart
that―――
<Page10>
"...Don't get any crazy misconceptions.
I wasn't myself back then. I was so thirsty that I
couldn't help myself. That's why I took off and went to
let off some steam on the Dead. You just happened to
get caught up in it. I ended up manipulating your body,
with no regard for your feelings."
<Page11>
"Even at the park―――I was this close to destroying
you."
<Page12>
...Arcueid's voice chokes up with anguish.
Biting her lip in silence, she profusely apologizes to
me with her whole body.
...Seeing her apologize like that hurts my heart.
I didn't feel like I was manipulated at all.
Rather―――it felt like I was indulging my own
desires.
<Page13>
"Arcueid, I――――"
"Don't apologize... Shiki, this was an accident.
I'll forget about it, so you should do so too. It'll be
better for both of us that way."
With that, she begins to quietly walk away.
<Page14>
"Ar―――"
I try to call her name, but I hesitate.
The hand I try to reach out and stop her with doesn't
move.
<Page15>
"...I'm sorry for giving you such a scare.
Goodbye, Shiki. I think it's best if we don't see each
other anymore."
<Page16>
And so, Arcueid disappears from the alley.
Wearing that forced smile all the way to the end.
She kicks off, just as she has so often before, like a
rabbit hopping on the moon.
<Page17>
"―――Why?"
Even if I want to chase after her, I can't.
Besides, I can't stop her, not the way I am now.
<Page18>
"―――Why are you the one who's apologizing?"
Self-hatred and remorse gnaw away at my heart.
On this tragic stage of an alley, I look up at the moon
in repentance.
