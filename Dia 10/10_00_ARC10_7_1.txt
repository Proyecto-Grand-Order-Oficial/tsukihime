―――I'll go to her apartment.
Maybe she gave up on hunting the Dead tonight and went
back to her place.
<Page2>
...I ring the bell.
No matter how long I wait, there is no answer.
I don't sense any movement beyond the door.
Has she not come back?
Or will she simply not come out?
<Page3>
"――――――."
I hesitate for a moment.
With a deep breath, I calm my flustered thoughts and
take out my knife.
<Page4>
I'll cut the line and kill the lock.
I'll apologize to Arcueid later.
But before I do, I lay my hand on the doorknob just to
be sure.
<Page5>
"...Hm?"
The door isn't locked.
With a click, it swings open freely.
<Page6>
"...Arcueid, are you there?"
There's no response.
The bed is also untouched.
She waited for me in the park all night, and then came
to my room to fetch me in the morning.
That means she probably hasn't been back here for over
twenty-four hours.
<Page7>
"...!"
I bash the wall with my fist and immediately rush back
out of the room.
I can condemn myself for my own stupidity later.
If I have time to take out my anger on the wall, I
should use it to go out to the city and look for her.
<Page8>
I come out of the station.
I squint my eyes at the abundance of people and
artificial lights.
...I walk around and search for the single woman at
random.
It's a desperate attempt, but there's a slim chance
it'll work.
As literal as it sounds, I'll follow the slender lines
in search of Arcueid.
