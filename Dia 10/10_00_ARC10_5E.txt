<Page1>
But, before I could confirm it for myself.
The loud crack of an explosion splits the air in front
of me, blowing Arcueid away like dust in the wind.
<Page2>
", that was scary...! I just took a chance and went
for it, but thank God she didn't fight back...!"
"Noel-sensei...!?"
<Page3>
"Hiiii, good evening!
But sorry, this is no time to chat!"
Noel-sensei walks over to stand beside me before
turning her sights on Arcueid.
<Page4>
...Arcueid is unharmed.
Despite having been blown back nearly ten whole meters,
there's not a scratch on her.
<Page5>
"I..."
Arcueid is reeling from the shock.
As am I―――I can't even work out what I should do in
this situation.
Meanwhile...
<Page6>
"Oops, right, that's no good, Shiki-kun.
After I'm done with her, you're next. I'm sorry, but
just sit tight for a second, okay ♡"
<Page7>
"!?"
A white barrier forms before me.
In the blink of an eye, three blades have been driven
into the ground around me.
Together they form a triangle, with me at its center,
trapped within a barrier of light―――
<Page8>
". Behold, the   Sacrament given to me
by my master―――the Temple.
Oh, and try not to touch the walls, okay? Otherwise
you'll turn into a pillar of salt. Well, not that it
matters to me whether your hand turns into salt or not.
In any case, the problem now is―――"
<Page9>
"Shi...ki―――?"
Arcueid stands up.
After seeing me imprisoned inside the barrier, she
shifts her gaze to the woman in nun's clothing beside
me.
<Page10>
"The problem now is... that I scored a surprise attack
on this monster and she's still completely unscathed...
. So my   just isn't strong enough to
get through."
"Executor―――"
Arcueid's aura changes.
Her eyes―――
They've become whirling maelstroms of hostility,
staring daggers at the woman in nun's clothing.
<Page11>
"What... do you think you're doing...?"
"...! I can't, I knew I couldn't do this!
I can't do anything against that thiiiing!"
<Page12>
"Shut it. You laborers should go at it even if it kills
ya.
Fighting monsters' supposed to be you people's fuckin'
job, ain't it?"
" ! Okay, fine, but after this
―――
to get me an audience with the Cardinal, okay?!"
<Page13>
As though being pushed from behind, the woman in nun's
clothing pitches forward and throws herself at Arcueid.
The outcome seems like a foregone conclusion.
There's no way she can stop Arcueid with a charge like
that.
<Page14>
"Let go―――of Shiki...!"
Sure enough, Arcueid runs toward us and swings a single
hand as if she were swatting at a fly―――
<Page15>
"Huh?!"
"No way?!"
<Page16>
W-What? How the heck was she able to stop Arcueid with
a half-hearted charge like that...?!
<Page17>
"'Ey, see? You  do it if you try. C'mon then, go
earn your pay.
It ain't free to feed you fuckers, y'know."
<Page18>
From right beside me, I hear fluent, but crass-sounding
Japanese.
Unable to move from where I am, I turn toward the
source.
And over there―――
is that foreign-looking boy I saw in front of the Tohno
mansion a little while back.
<Page19>
Both of the child's hands are fitted with what look
like gauntlets.
His fingers are furiously working up and down, clicking
noisily as they move.
They almost remind me of an old-school typewriter for
some reason.
<Page20>
"Hm? What're ya lookin' at, kid? This ain't even that
rare, y'know? And don't go sayin' some stupid shit like
you've never seen a marionette before. Here I thought
all Japanese valued diligence."
<Page21>
It seems like he's talking to me.
But... are we on the same page about what a marionette
is?
I thought it was one of those articulated wooden dolls
with strings; the ones that street performers can
deftly manipulate from above to give the impression
that the doll is 'alive'.
<Page22>
", this dipshit can't even last two minutes...
Fuckin' figures. Guess now we gotta hash it out
instead.#
―――
'Ey! Stand down, Noel! You're gonna lose your
fuckin' head!"
<Page23>
A never-ending flurry of blows.
The woman in nun's clothing beats a hasty retreat.
Arcueid, her shoulders heaving with each labored
breath, turns to face the barrier of light―――to face
me.
<Page24>
"――― ―――!"
Her eyes glow a brilliant red.
Arcueid crouches low to the ground, panting heavily,
like a hulking predator getting ready to pounce. She
looks set to clear the distance between us in a single
bound, but―――
<Page25>
"Man, what a godawful sight. Ain't much different from
some trashy-ass Ghoul. Am I really supposed to believe
you're the last True Ancestor, Princess? If Ol'
Laurentis saw you right now, I bet he'd be real
disappointed."
"―――What... did you say?"
<Page26>
Sanity returns to Arcueid's eyes.
The child next to me must have seen this as his chance,
as he takes a step forward to confront the vampire in
white.
<Page27>
"Pleasure to meet you. The name's Mario Gallo Bestino,
Acting Presbyter of the Eastern Consolate.
And don't start grillin' me 'bout my high rank. Don't
like talkin' about it, but my ol' man's got a bunch of
'conveniently adopted' kids like me."
"I see... I take it you're the commander of the
Executors in this country?"
<Page28>
"Yeah,  got stationed here though.
Sure, I'm just ridin' Laurentis's coattails, but a
title's a title. Ain't gonna let people run loose on 
island―――'Specially if it involves a fuck-up True
Ancestor that has fallen to evil. I'd rather eat shit
than deal with that."
<Page29>
"――――――"
Arcueid's will to fight vanishes.
No... perhaps it's more like she's afraid.
<Page30>
" you realize. You get you were 'bout to suck
his blood and kill him, right?
You True Ancestors think you're so fuckin' special, but
you're no different from any other bloodsucker, are ya?
Even if ya run around exterminatin' other vampires,
doesn't do much to change that you're a monster just
like them!"
"I... wouldn't even think about killing Shiki."
<Page31>
"C'mon now, don't be so fuckin' coy. We ain't talkin'
about murder here. This is about nature runnin' its
course. Your presence alone's enough to cause problems.
Thought you knew that. Did you not fuckin' hear the way
this kid screamed when he saw the real you?"
"―――――"
<Page32>
"Can't believe what I'm fuckin' seein'. Sure, go ahead
and get mad at me just 'cause what I'm sayin's right.
The ol' man told me you were a stone-cold killin'
machine, but turns out, you're basically just some
failed human.
But whatever. Those are the eyes―――the malicious
eyes you turned to that kid. And that indecent
wheezin'... like some whore tryna come onto a guy.
Maybe we should ask how the man himself felt about
that, huh?"
<Page33>
The boy... Mario, finally turns to me.
The sharpness of his gaze leaves me speechless.
Despite his foul mouth, the boy is... how do I put
this―――brimming with fairness.
<Page34>
"Stage's yours, Tohno. Give us your thoughts.
About how you were so close to gettin' chowed down on
that it almost made ya shit yourself in terror!"
"――――――"
I was about to scream that it's not true, but stop
myself.
<Page35>
Because that would be a lie.
In truth, I  scared. Trying to hide that fact would
hurt Arcueid more than lying to her―――
<Page36>
"―――――――"
Arcueid looks away like she's in pain.
<Page37>
"It's just as the Acting Presbyter says. Fall back,
vampire. Did you think that we would allow a monster
like you to hang around with a human being?"
<Page38>
"Forcing a human into serving you―――.
It's the sort of despicable idea that befits a vampire,
but we won't let you get away with it.
You should be thanking us, Shiki-kun. You were this
close to being turned into a vampire."
<Page39>
"――――――"
No. That can't be right. It's true that I was afraid.
That's an undeniable fact. But that's something she
would  do.
<Page40>
It hasn't happened even once.
She's always respected my choices.
Her forcing me... hasn't happened even once.
I only ever stayed together with Arcueid because I, and
I alone, wanted to do so! That's all!
<Page41>
"You're wrong...! Who are you people, showing up out of
nowhere and acting like you know everything...?!
Arcueid has never sucked blood, not even once! What
happened earlier was just a joke...!"
<Page42>
"What are you on about...? Did you just say that she's
never sucked blood? You expect us to believe that
bullshit?
It's true that this True Ancestor is exceptional. There
are no records of her claiming any victims over the
last 800 years. But even so, that's―――"
<Page43>
"Shut up! None of that crap matters...!
Listen up. If you ever get in Arcueid's way, I'll never
forgive you, no matter who you are.
Besides, I―――#I'm here with her because I want to be!
Outsiders like you have no right to get involved!"
<Page44>
"...Really? You won't forgive us, you say?"
Noel's voice has an edge to it.
Some fraction of what she'd brought to bear against
Arcueid is now directed at me.
Blade still dangling in her hand, she begins to slowly
advance―――
<Page45>
"'Ey, Fatass Noel."
"Huh? Fatass? Did you just call me fat? Which part?
Why?
Anyway, my weight doesn't matter: your foul mouth is
the problem here! Just because you're the spoiled kid
of some bigwig doesn't mean you can call me whatever
you―――
#!!!!?"
<Page46>
"Uh... what..."
The woman in nun's clothing lets out a peculiar scream
and suddenly starts bouncing around spontaneously.
The bloodlust she harbored a second ago has vanished
into thin air.
I think I'm beginning to understand just where
Noel-sensei stands in the pecking order...
<Page47>
"Real sorry for this brainless idiot causin' a fuss.
Turns out that despite bein' such a coward, she loses
her cool fast as hell. I'll give her a real good
spankin' later, so hope you'll be willin' to overlook
this.
Still... dumbass or not, she does bring up some good
points.
'She hasn't sucked blood once'... ain't that a great
fuckin' story, Tohno? Right? Don'tcha think so too,
Arcueid Brunestud?"
<Page48>
"Arcueid...?"
She does not respond.
She simply looks down and bites her lip in frustration.
It's...
It's as if she's implicitly admitting to what that boy
just said―――
<Page49>
"Also, lemme make this clear: that Barrier ain't meant
to capture the kid. Had no choice but to put it up to
protect the poor lil guy against the scary monster
here. Free of charge, too.
I don't gotta spell out what I mean by that, ?"
<Page50>
"........."
Arcueid raises her head.
'I'm sorry.'
In a barely audible voice, she makes her apology―――
before leaping away, as though fleeing into the
darkness of the night.
