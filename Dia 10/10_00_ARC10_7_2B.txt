<Page1>
"...I don't... know how much this is... going to help,
but―――"
Arcueid is a creature of very little death.
In this world that's brimming with death, she alone is
nearly unmarked by those lines.
<Page2>
Given that―――if I cast my eyes over the city like
this, searching for places without any lines, I can
give chase without the risk of missing her.
It's a half-baked strategy, but it's all I've got.
<Page3>
"――――"
Pain rips through me.
...I try to take in the overall picture without
focusing too much on each individual line.
According to her, this pain puts a burden on my brain.
I can't let my eyes be exposed for too long.
<Page4>
"As I thought... she isn't on the main street."
The people walking around the business district all
have the usual number of lines.
I don't spot any people smeared head to toe in them, as
I had before.
<Page5>
"... ...!"
I massage my temples with my fingers.
My headache will continue getting stronger as long as I
have my glasses off.
But even so―――holding on to the sliver of hope that
she's somewhere near, I press on, eyes wide open.
<Page6>
...It's okay. It'll get a little easier from here.
If I enter the empty back alleys, I'll have far fewer
lines to contend with.
That's why I must quickly head to the dark underbelly
of this city.
Within that darkness, where even the light of the moon
can't reach, it should be easy to spot her white
figure―――
<Page7>
"――― ――――"
The exhaustion from all this running combined with my
headache makes me wanna throw up.
When I place my hand on my forehead, it's immediately
clear I'm running a severe fever.
I don't need a thermometer to tell my temperature is
through the roof. Even back when I caught a bad cold
and was running a fever of almost forty degrees, my
palm didn't feel this hot.
<Page8>
"...But, here――――"
This marks the final destination of my search.
Just up ahead is the back alley where I first spoke
with her.
If she isn't here, then that means my guess was wrong.
<Page9>
"......Huh?"
The moment I step inside, I feel a chill.
<Page10>
A chill strong enough to cool even the forty-degree
fever in my head.
―――I see something strange.
Deep within that darkness, sparks are scattering wildly
through the air.
No, to be more precise...
A great number of lines are swarming together,
bursting, and disappearing.
<Page11>
"――――Don't tell me she's..."
Those swarming lines of death belong to the Dead.
If they're being extinguished, then that means...
"She's fighting by herself... in that state...?!"
<Page12>
My fatigue, my headache, my stupidity, and even the
chills from earlier become a thing of the past.
I push open the rusty iron gate and slip into the dark
passage.
<Page13>
The entrance of the back alley.
The thin path between buildings.
The spray from each of those deaths forms a muddy
stream.
No fewer than a hundred brutal dissections.
It's strange. I'm familiar with the layout of this
area. There's not enough space for a hundred Dead to
fit inside.
That's why the scene unfolding before me...
must be a single body ripped apart into dozens of
pieces.
<Page14>
"――――――"
I don't know. I don't think about what this all means.
The thing that I can't stand―――
Is the sound of my spine grating every time I take
another step down this path.
<Page15>
"―――――."
My instinct rasps like a saw against my brainstem.
Stop. Don't go. Turn back.
What lies ahead is not the thing you've seen in your
dreams.
<Page16>
"Shut―――up."
I already know that.
I won't turn back.
I won't leave Arcueid alone.
<Page17>
―――If I were to run away, that woman will get
herself killed.
Unable to shake that dire premonition, I drag myself
one foot at a time toward that blind spot laced with
death―――
<Page18>
"――――――"
Inside―――
Not a single Dead remains in one piece.
<Page19>
My consciousness freezes.
The scene assaults my eyes.
The ground is awash in red effluent.
Only scraps of the Dead remain; faceless, arms crushed,
guts spilled, senselessly ravaged beyond all
recognition.
<Page20>
I'm rendered speechless by the suffocating stench of
blood, and the chilling air of death run rampant.
The walls, the floor, no doubt even the moon high
above―――
Everything here is red.
<Page21>
I hear a thick, splattering sound.
With her hand, she annihilates the scribble-covered
human figure. Perhaps it's the final one.
<Page22>
With a single hand. Casually. Without mercy. As though
squashing an insect.
The Dead's head is grabbed by an invisible hand and
crushed midair, splattering its blood and spinal fluid
onto the walls like paint.
<Page23>
"Ar―――cueid."
A world where even the moon is red.
Arcueid stands at the center of it all.
<Page24>
She doesn't notice my presence.
She simply looks up at the moon―――heavily breathing
in and out, as if in a trance.
<Page25>
"―――――"
I can't... call out to her.
The grating of my spine has reached its peak.
It's as if that saw has already severed my brainstem.
<Page26>
――――. .
My consciousness is screaming at me.
It's telling me that being here is a mistake.
It shouts that I don't want to die yet.
<Page27>
But it's all too late.
Being neither white nor red, I am a foreign object in
this space.
The white figure turns around.
She glares at me with a single eye, like a demon.
―――Such a dazzling, golden eye.
<Page28>
It's not that our eyes meet.
I just happened to look into that 'eye'.
That alone―――
Is enough to set my blood coursing, and wipe away my
higher brain functions.
<Page29>
The first thing that I feel is pure survival instinct.
I mustn't be here. I mustn't look at that thing.
I mustn't be known. I mustn't be seen.
We CANNOT talk. We CANNOT coexist. We CANNOT reach a
conclusion.
I CANNOT FIGHT. I CANNOT ESCAPE. I DO NOT STAND A
CHANCE.
In SHORT, no MATTER WHAT I DO,# YOU# CANNOT# BE SAVED.
<Page30>
That's right. That creature is on a whole other level.
It's not that she's of a higher or lower class, it's
that she's on a completely different scale.
It's too different. It's too different. It's too
different. That's why―――
<Page31>
All the blood vessels in my body swell.
First comes fear.
But after it follows an almost rapturous urge to kill.
<Page32>
A flash of lightning from a blue sky. A clear solution
never before seen in the history of mankind.
My cells rejoice at the arrival of enlightenment on par
with that of the Buddha.
Why? Because that thing is something that 
exist.
For us, that thing is unnecessary.
That's why I'll kill it. Kill it now. Right here.
Immediately.
I'll give in to my racing blood and expel that thing.
<Page33>
My heart leaps.
Even though I know I can't win, my entire body rumbles,
telling me to kill her.
Such contradiction.
Is it saying that if I don't want to die, then I should
kill?
Is it saying that I should kill even if I'll die?
Is there nothing in my head other than murder?
<Page34>
"――――Ah."
I can't. My own self isn't even present.
That eye. I mustn't look into that golden eye.
There's no way I can do it. I can't pull myself away
from that woman's eye.
. . My blood is boiling.
I can't stand against this raging current.
However, there's something that's trying to break
through my shell of reason.
<Page35>
"―――― ―――"
Why do I want to kill her?
Is it because I don't want to die, so I'm going to kill
her before she can kill me?
It's so hilarious that I might die laughing. This
really is the ultimate form of stupidity.
There's no need for a reason to kill.
Be honest with yourself, Tohno Shiki.
A long time ago, you... that woman...
<Page36>
"Shut―――up."
No, I'm the one who should be shutting up.
That's exactly right.
I simply wanted that woman... I wanted Arcueid, that's
all there was to it.
From the very moment I saw her, I understood that fact
so well that I wanted to vomit.
<Page37>
"―――――."
That's right. Every part of me wants her.
Even my mind, my body,
My tears, my saliva,
My blood, my flesh, my lust, and my impatience.
My breathing is going mad. I can barely stay conscious.
Her golden eye swaying in the dark.
This is,
 something that killing alone won't satisfy.
<Page38>
"―――Shiki...?"
The woman's eye returns to red.
But at this point―――
It's far too late.
<Page39>
"...!"
I hear a muffled scream.
I don't care. I hold the knife in my hand and press
myself against the woman's body.
There's no strength left in her. Pinning her down is
easy.
I straddle her, wrap one arm around her neck, and with
the other raise the knife high in the air.
<Page40>
All that remains now―――
Is to plunge it down between her breasts in one blow.
<Page41>
"Calm down, Shiki...!
Using your eyes more will be disastrous...!"
<Page42>
I hear the woman's voice.
―――The contents of my head are simmering away.
<Page43>
'Shut up...!'
I tighten my arm around her neck.
The woman clenches her jaw in pain.
...I can't believe this.
Even though she's such an incredibly powerful lifeform,
right now she can't even shake off my arm.
<Page44>
"Shi―――ki."
Still desperately fighting for breath, the woman gasped
those words.
.
My frenzied blood makes my heart pound.
<Page45>
'―――――――――――!'
My breathing goes haywire.
My vision won't work properly.
It's as if my body has turned into lava.
It's so scorching, so hot that I want to be released
from this pain immediately.
<Page46>
'――――――――――――'
I shift my body.
I slide my hips over the woman's abdomen.
I spread Arcueid's legs and lower my body through the
gap.
<Page47>
"Shi...ki...!"
She looks back at me uneasily.
Her gaze only makes my brain bubble more furiously.
<Page48>
'――――――――――――'
I'm turgid. I feel like I'm in a trance.
Every cell in my body rejoices; this is the moment I
was born for.
If I don't ■ this woman at once, I'll definitely go
mad.
<Page49>
Her flushed cheeks.
Her tender neck.
Beneath me is the body of a woman, nothing more,
nothing less.
<Page50>
'―――――――――'
I can feel her pulse.
'―――――――――'
Golden. Those eyes that seemed to ensnare my very soul.
<Page51>
I let go of her neck with my arm.
I lay my hand on the woman's breasts.
I touch her body. I touch her legs.
I crawl my fingers across her white belly and feel the
warmth of her flesh.
<Page52>
"This―――"
<Page53>
"This is wrong―――this isn't like you, Shiki...!"
A feverish voice.
Pleading red eyes.
With that, I completely lose all control of my
thoughts.
<Page54>
"...!"
I hear her whimper as she tries to conceal her shame.
The woman desperately tries to push me away with her
hands.
I seize both of those arms.
I pin them to the ground so that she can't move.
Perhaps it would be easier if I had some nails.
With her hands pinned down like this, she looks like a
crucified sacrifice.
Her eyes glare back at the man on top of her, filled
with disgust and obvious misery.
<Page55>
Her appearance is far too alluring.
I can't use my arms either. If I let go, this woman
will no doubt cut off my head.
I crack a smile under the pressure.
Rather than violating her on the spot, a struggle to
the death is far more appropriate for animals like us.
<Page56>
"Stop, it―――if you don't, you'll regret, it―――"
With one arm, I grab onto her beautiful, white, white,
white, white throat.
My mouth is the only thing I have left free. I sink my
teeth into the woman's breast.
<Page57>
"..., Shiki, calm down―――!"
She continues to mount a feeble resistance, even as her
body twitches.
――――.
The heavy breaths of a man trace across the woman's
abdomen.
<Page58>
"――――...!"
The woman must be quite sensitive, as that alone is
enough to make her squirm.
I push her clothes out of the way, dragging my tongue
across her white skin.
Suddenly, I realize that I'm hungry.
That's right. My stomach is always empty. I'm always
hungry.
I drool from the appetite that I've never had until
now.
<Page59>
"Shi...ki, no...!"
The woman puts strength into her arms, but my appetite
is stronger.
Right. What am I so hesitant about?
This is no different to the meal earlier.
<Page60>
Only then, I was the one being eaten. This time, I am
the one doing the eating.
We may be different lifeforms, but the way we do things
as living organisms is exactly the same.
Her sucking blood at the park, the foolish urges I feel
now, the hamburgers we ate this afternoon―――they're
all the same.
You eat because it's necessary. You eat because it's
fun.
You eat because you want to. ―――You crave each other
because you love each other.
<Page61>
That's all there is to it. That's all you need as an
animal.
Resistance is inevitable.
Her breasts softly bounce up and down.
Their shape is splendid. Solid proof that she's a
woman.
With that, I dig my teeth into one of them.
<Page62>
"――――!"
The woman lets out a yelp.
She twitches, arcing her body like a drawn bow.
It makes no difference.
I sink my teeth in further, stopping just short of
biting it off to run my tongue over it, relishing the
taste.
<Page63>
"Shi...ki..., stop...!"
The woman's body temperature is rising.
There's no trace left of the coldness from earlier.
"―――――――!"
The woman desperately stifles her voice, as though
she's embarrassed by it.
<Page64>
"Shiki――――if you keep doing this, you'll―――"
A pitiful voice.
My consciousness begins to slip away.
Even though I abandoned all reason and thought, I'm
still losing sight of who I really am.
<Page65>
"...... stop, it... or... I'll never, forgive...
you...!"
A sorrowful voice.
I don't know what it means. I can't hear something like
that.
I raise my knife. My eyes become clouded with vermilion
red.
―――I'm imbued with the same murderous intent I'd
been on the receiving end of before.
I can't stop my own body.
<Page66>
"No... Shiki, I'm begging, you―――"
A mournful voice.
With tears flowing from her eyes―――
"This isn't right... you... don't, even... like...
me...!"
<Page67>
"―――――"
A headache courses through me.
My instincts shout at me to keep going.
If I stop here, I'll lose my life.
My heart races, knowing that if I don't hold this woman
down, she'll definitely come for my head in the future.
<Page68>
"――――――"
But she's crying.
That woman, who always kept on earnestly smiling no
matter what, is crying.
I don't believe it. I won't allow it.
If it was me―――I would never have made her cry.
<Page69>
A headache courses through me.
It screams at me to get on with it.
My consciousness becomes blurred with conflicting
impulses.
I ask myself one last time what I want to do.
I―――――
C:> Simply want her.
C:> Can't get myself to hate her.
