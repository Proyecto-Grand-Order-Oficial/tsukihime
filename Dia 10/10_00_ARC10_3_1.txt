It's not like we're going out on a date, but a movie is
standard fare.
There should be no risk of her getting bored so long as
the movie is interesting enough, and once we've seen
it, we can use it as a jumping-off point to get to know
each other's preferences and interests a little better.
<Page2>
Yeah, that's not a bad idea at all.
At times like this, nothing beats the movie theater.
But just to reiterate, this is by no means a date.
<Page3>
"This place is always bustling, huh. I don't really
know what everything is, but there's a bunch of
attractions around here, right?"
<Page4>
I walk through the daylit city with Arcueid by my side.
As we went along, other passersby were―――or rather,
still are―――stealing furtive glances at the two of
us.
Needless to say, it's because Arcueid is the sort of
beautiful woman you don't come across every day.
<Page5>
With all the extra eyes on me, I've gotten so
self-conscious that I'm unable to respond to the
questions she's been hurling at me.
<Page6>
"Hey, are you even listening, Shiki?
I'm trying to ask you where we're going from here."
<Page7>
"I'm listening. We're already here, though.
See that? That's the movie theater we're headed to."
<Page8>
"A movie theater... Hmm, so we're watching a movie."
...Maybe it was a bit too plain after all.
The princess is clearly not feeling it.
However, we've already come all the way here, so
there's no backing out now.
<Page9>
Besides, how am I supposed to know what kind of place
would make a vampire girl happy?
When one has come this far, there's no other option but
to rush headlong past the complaints and the
grumblings.
<Page10>
"Let's just go in.
If you aren't happy with it, you can go off and do
something else on your own."
"Ah... Well, it's not like I'm  it."
<Page11>
With a heavy sigh, Arcueid trudges after me.
Seeing her shoulders fall dejectedly like she's
complaining about how useless I am makes my back ache.
<Page12>
"I'll buy the tickets, what do you want to watch?
Right now they're showing, uhh... a romance, a romance,
and more romance.#"
What kind of overly saccharine movie theater is this?
<Page13>
"You've got to be kidding me... even I want to go home
now."
"I'm fine with whatever. They all look the same to me.
I'll put up with it, even if it's boring. We've made
our bed, so now we have to lie in it, right?"
<Page14>
I think I've heard that phrase somewhere before... This
is all on me for not checking the showings online
beforehand.
<Page15>
"...I'm ashamed. I'll try my best to pick something
that looks interesting, at least."
<Page16>
I join the small queue and purchase tickets for two.
Arcueid is... a vampire... but, she's also a foreigner,
so maybe she'd prefer a Western film to a Japanese one.
I'll go with the one made in France.
The screening starts in ten minutes.
<Page17>
"Thanks for waiting. The movie begins in ten minutes,
so why don't we wait in the coffee shop over there. It
must be painful to be out here in the sun, right?"
<Page18>
"Geez, didn't I tell you that whether I'm in pain or
feel sleepy has nothing to do with the time of day?
I have no problem with standing here if it's just ten
minutes. The next time you bring up that I'm a vampire,
I'll seriously get mad!"
<Page19>
Her anger rose at mach speed...
But she's right. I may have overstepped my bounds.
Arcueid is many times stronger than I am, so being
overly protective of her would just make her more
annoyed than anything.
<Page20>
"Understood. In that case, let's kill some time here."
I lean against the wall of the department store.
Arcueid watches the passing crowds, her ill temper
written on her face.
I steal a glance at her profile.
<Page21>
I would never have taken her to the movie theater if I
knew she was going to be like this... I should have
taken her to the park, or perhaps even spent more money
to go to an amusement park. If I had done that, maybe
she wouldn't look so bored and gloomy.
<Page22>
"Shiki.# I'm bored. Do something."
...That was fast.
So she's already at the point of 'I'm bored, show me a
magic trick'.
<Page23>
"...Man, could you act any more like a princess?
Besides, what do you mean 'do something'?"
"Hmm, how about <shiritori|w o r d   c h a i n    >?"
"Huh?"
I raise my eyebrows. Why that all of a sudden?
<Page24>
...I look behind her. Standing a little ways away by
the wall is another couple, engrossed in a game of
shiritori.
<Aishiteru|I   l o v e   y o u    >, <ruamondo|l u m o n d e    >, <dokomademo|w h e r e v e r     >, <montesukyuu|M o n t e s q u i e u     >... I doubt
I'm the only person that would be dizzy after hearing a
string of words like that.
This is why couples who don't pay attention to the
people around them are so...!
<Page25>
"Let's not. I don't like shiritori."
"But why? The people over there said that couples like
to play it while waiting for a movie."
<Page26>
"That's a load of nonsense, forget it. Besides, playing
shiritori to kill time? You can only get so
old-fashioned. Go look up news on your phone or
something."
"Really? But those two look like they're having fun."
<Page27>
"That couple would have fun no matter what they do!
Besides, I'm bad at that game. I get sad when I play
it. That's the only thing I absolutely refuse to play."
"You aren't very skilled at it? Is it because your
vocabulary is too small?"
<Page28>
"I'm not unskilled, I'm just not good at it. Plus like,
it's boring, right? All you're doing is stringing words
together.
...Whatever. The movie starts in five minutes, so we
should head in. Here's your ticket. You just have to
show it to them when we enter. They'll take half of it
away, but that's just the procedure, so don't get upset
about it, okay?"
<Page29>
"I'm aware of how it works, thanks. You think I'm just
some utterly clueless woman, don't you?"
"Ah... no, not really. I just thought that you would be
unfamiliar with the norms of human society."
<Page30>
"Didn't I tell you that I've done my homework? Even I
know what a movie theater is."
<Page31>
Arcueid spins on her heel and heads into the theater.
...This really wasn't the right choice.
Even though I brought the princess all the way to the
movie theater, it seems she doesn't find it interesting
after all...
<Page32>
―――We leave the theater.
The movie that we watched was a romance, so it wasn't
exactly boring, but it wasn't particularly interesting
either.
It was a typical French movie, so it focused on
maintaining a quiet atmosphere without any stand-out
action scenes.
<Page33>
Arcueid walks beside me in silence.
"......"
...This silence is awkward.
Perhaps she also would've been happier if it had been
an action or a horror movie.
<Page34>
"Hey, Arcueid. I know the one we saw today
wasn't―――"
<Page35>
"Yeah, that was soooo fun, Shiki!"
―――Wait, it was actually a smash hit?!
<Page36>
"Huh, but..."
Fun and boring are subjective, but was  really that
fun?!
<Page37>
"Man, I didn't know seeing it would be so different
compared to hearing about it.
I had some intel on what to expect, sure, but the real
thing was far beyond anything I could have possibly
imagined!"
<Page38>
"Maybe being in the dark is what made it so special.
The sound was loud, but somehow it wasn't overbearing,
and it was also fun sitting next to you.
But most of all, the story was spectacular!
How extravagant! I'm surprised at how a fictional story
could be taken to such lengths! The images I create in
my head are like child's play compared to the fine
details in those scenes. I'm seriously in awe!"
<Page39>
Arcueid is grinning from ear to ear from the bottom of
her heart.
It seems that she truly took enjoyment from that
refined romance movie.
<Page40>
"I-Is that so? Well, I admit that Eiffel-Tower-looking
building was quite impressive."
But come on, isn't it just a rip-off of the Skytree?
<Page41>
"Huh? Shiki, you don't seem very excited.
Don't tell me you were bored?"
"Well, it's not that it was boring, but it felt
pretty... average.
If you wanted something like that, there are much more
interesting films out there."
<Page42>
"No way. But the one we saw was absolutely incredible!"
<Page43>
"...Hmm, I think your standards may just be a bit low.
They're not showing them right now because they're out
of season, but any major blockbuster would put a movie
like that to shame. To put it bluntly, the one we just
saw was somewhat below average."
<Page44>
"No way."
"...You really wear your emotions on your sleeve, don't
you, Arcueid?"
<Page45>
I'm just as amazed as she is surprised.
She'd been acting so cold about the movie going in that
I fully assumed she'd come out complaining about it,
but instead, she's like an excited child.
<Page46>
"...It's a shame. There's a recent movie that was
really top-notch, but they stopped showing it in
theaters yesterday. If I'd known that you would enjoy
it so much, I'd have taken you the other night."
<Page47>
...I have to admit, I didn't think of it because I
wanted to thank her, or show her my gratitude. It's
more that I genuinely wanted to see how she'd smile
after seeing a movie like that.
<Page48>
"Is that so? How unfortunate, for the both of us."
Arcueid slumps her shoulders in disappointment.
"I know, right? It's like we just keep striking out."
I slump my shoulders in the same way.
<Page49>
...Yeah, it's a shame.
I would have liked to see that joyful side of hers for
a little while longer.
