<Page1>
It's past two o'clock now, so we decide to have a late
lunch.
Since I'm here with Arcueid, I wanted to splurge and
eat somewhere a little more expensive than I normally
would. Alas, the contents of my wallet won't stretch
 that far.
<Page2>
"I want to go somewhere you usually eat!"
Arcueid says she wants something ordinary anyway,# so I
suck it up and take us to the food court.
<Page3>
It's an open question whether or not Arcueid even eats
this sort of food, so this is somewhat of an
experiment.
After intensely studying the menu, Arcueid ended up
getting the same meal that I ordered.
<Page4>
"......"
I take a seat across from Arcueid.
After nervously glancing around at her surroundings,
she brings a fry to her mouth in a manner that suggests
familiarity with such food.
<Page5>
"You're used to this.
I thought for sure this would be your first time in a
place like this."
<Page6>
"Well, this  my first time. I knew what sort of
establishment this was beforehand, but it was just
second-hand knowledge."
<Page7>
"Second-hand knowledge... I see. You watch the news, so
you must have read magazines as well. Your clothes are
normal too, so I guess you've adapted pretty well..."
<Page8>
The traditional Western image of a vampire, combined
with Vlov's old-fashioned look, had left me with the
impression that vampires are Gothic creatures. I guess
it's possible that vampire society may also have
modernized along with the rest of the world.
<Page9>
"Hmm, that's not quite the process I use to acclimate.
Either way, if I'm to blend in with human civilization,
I need to develop some baseline level of general
knowledge, right?
That's why whenever I wake up, I spend some time
learning about the current time period before I begin
to act. I usually settle my business within a day or
two though, after which all that knowledge just becomes
dead weight."
<Page10>
"Hm...?"
Every now and then, she says things that can be
difficult to understand.
<Page11>
"What do you mean by dead weight?"
"I mean, I go straight back to sleep as soon as I'm
done.
I don't know how many years it'll be before I wake up
again, so I have to throw out everything I've learned
and prepare for my next awakening."
"Hmm...
<Page12>
 But it feels like by doing so I'm losing out.
You see, up until now, I knew nothing about this world
outside of raw information#.
Even though I knew that people gathered here like this,
I'd never experienced it first-hand."
<Page13>
"I see... but isn't knowledge enough? In fact, just
now, you seemed a little lost when confronted with the
menu, but when the time came to actually place your
order, you were totally prepared."
"Of course. I've read up on how to handle those kinds
of interactions, after all."
<Page14>
"But that had only been in a numerical sense.
Seeing the world as pure information is 'real' in and
of itself, but the tangible 'reality' of lived
experience has a pith to it that surpasses any theory,
no matter how correct it may be on paper.
This must be what they mean when they say experience
outweighs theory.
No matter how many billions of words you learn, you
won't get anywhere if you don't start stringing them
together yourself."
<Page15>
Arcueid lets out a miserable sigh.
<Page16>
"I'm not so sure about that. There's also a saying
along the lines of 'theory supplements experience',
isn't there?"
"That's something only a person without any real
experience would say though, right?
Well... I guess that included me up until recently."
<Page17>
Arcueid's facial expression grows darker and darker.
...
I must've gotten swept up in her words. I'm starting
to feel depressed myself. I don't feel like I could
eloquently express , but I just can't bear seeing
her face like this.
<Page18>
"Isn't that conclusion a bit premature, though? I think
that what it all boils down to is that there are people
who can make up for their lack of experience with
theory alone, and those who can overturn theory with
the benefit of their experiences.
I mean, look around us. In this shop alone, we have
such a breadth of different people. Yet even among all
these different people, none of them are the same as
me, right?"
<Page19>
"Wow,# you're saying something serious for once."
"You're the one who brought up a serious subject, I'm
just following your lead. Please don't derail the
conversation now."
Especially not now that you've finally decided to talk
about yourself.
<Page20>
"Yeah, I know. You're there for me when I have
something I want to talk about, whenever I want to talk
about it.
Even though you yell at me all the time, you always
listen when things get serious, right?"
<Page21>
Arcueid lets out a cheery laugh.
I can't say this out loud, but her smile really isn't
vampire-like at all.
That said... have I really been yelling at her that
often?
<Page22>
"I'm quite narrow-minded, aren't I? Whenever I decide
on something,# I end up blind to everything else.
'I don't need anyone else but myself'. 'It's fine as
long as I'm right'. I only ever thought along those
lines."
<Page23>
"But you're right. When you consider how many different
kinds of individuals there are, it's only natural to
assume that there are plenty of people in the world who
can do things I can't like it's nothing."
Arcueid's tone is gentle as she muses. I guess she's
feeling a little introspective.
<Page24>
"Then again, no amount of reflection is actually going
to change my personality.
Besides, I like the way I am right now the best. I
still believe this is the correct way for me to be."
<Page25>
After making such a gallant statement with a smile,
Arcueid once again furtively looks around her
surroundings before sinking her teeth into her
hamburger.
<Page26>
. .
She chows down on the junk food as if to dispel my
image of her as a vampire.
"......"
I wonder how she manages it.
 Eating a hamburger is the
sort of thing that's basically impossible to do
elegantly, which only makes the fact that Arcueid looks
so beautiful doing it seem all the more out of place.
<Page27>
"...What? It's rude to stare.
Ah, am I eating this wrong...?!"
<Page28>
Arcueid puts the hamburger back on the tray in a panic.
She wipes her lips with a napkin. Even that commonplace
action looks so elegant and graceful when she does it.
<Page29>
"No, not at all. You're doing it right, but it feels
kind of strange seeing  do it. It just doesn't suit
you, so you shouldn't eat it."
"What's up with that? What do you mean it doesn't suit
me?"
<Page30>
"It's an image problem. Fast food doesn't suit a person
with a small mouth like yours. It's fine when you
daintily nibble on the fries, so you can have mine as
well."
<Page31>
I put my fries on Arcueid's tray.
Even I don't understand why I'm acting like this.
<Page32>
"I don't want them. I finally get a chance to eat
something, but if I only eat soft things like those, it
barely feels like I'm eating anything at all."
<Page33>
Arcueid pouts before digging back into her hamburger.
This time, her movements are highly exaggerated, like
she's conscious of the fact that I'm watching her.
The mysterious beauty from before has faded slightly,
making the scene just about bearable.
<Page34>
But... just what the hell is going on? A vampire eating
a hamburger?
If a creature doesn't eat and receive the nutrients it
needs to function, then it won't survive very long.
<Page35>
Arcueid said before that she doesn't drink blood.
Then... does that mean she derives sustenance from the
same sorts of food that people eat?
<Page36>
"Hey... Arcueid."
"What do you want you bully?"
<Page37>
"Look, I won't complain any more.
There's something I want to ask you, if that's okay."
"Sure but―――what is it?"
<Page38>
"So, you're a vampire, right? What I was wondering
is... well, vampires only feed on blood, don't they?"
<Page39>
Arcueid stares at me, eyes wide.
Looks like it was an inappropriate question after
all...
I mean look,# her face has become so stiff...# Or not?
<Page40>
"Listen, Shiki. I don't actually  to eat.
It's true that consuming nutrients like this allows me
to move under my own strength, but whether I do so or
not is simply a matter of preference."
<Page41>
"My method of replenishing calories is different from
yours. I do have an appetite, but it's more analogous
to the sex drive in human beings.
I get irritated when I don't eat, sure, but since I
don't place a lot of importance on food, I don't get
struck by   very often."
<Page42>
Arcueid flatly refutes my blood diet theory.
It seems like she really  get by just fine without
drinking any blood.
<Page43>
"I see――――"
Thank goodness. I'm so glad that she's not like the
other vampires that kill humans in order to feed.
<Page44>
Geez... If Arcueid had been like:
'I'm a vampire that doesn't need to suck blood.'
From the get-go, I'd have been more than happy to help
her... out...
<Page45>
"Wait, hold on!#Wouldn't that make you not a vampire?!"
<Page46>
"No, I still am. If you had to eat something with no
flavor all the time, it would be unbearable, right?
There are times when you want to eat something that
contains more poison than it does nutrients. Kinda like
this hamburger you just ate."
<Page47>
"Shiki, why did you choose this restaurant?
Was it simply to replenish energy?
Or maybe―――you had a deep-seated craving for this
haphazardly-cooked, mass-produced lump of low-quality
processed meat, cheap bread, and artificial
flavorings?"
"... It pains me to admit it, but it's because I
wanted a hamburger..."
<Page48>
"Yeah, that's okay. I don't think that's anything to be
embarrassed about.
Even I see it as something delicious, despite knowing
that it's bad for me."
<Page49>
"For me, human blood is much the same thing.
We're the same in that we both have cravings for things
that we don't strictly need."
<Page50>
"I mean, whether we're talking food or we're talking
mating, intelligent creatures wouldn't bother with it
if it didn't provide some secondary benefit, right?
You eat things because they taste good#.
You mate because it feels good.
You human beings are the ultimate examples of this. You
know that connecting things with pleasure is a more
powerful tool for prosperity than any other. It's a
cosmically rare example of a relatively weak species
demonstrating the absolute strongest capability to
survive."
<Page51>
Arcueid's voice has a sing-song quality to it.
I couldn't feel any contempt for humans in what she
said.
On the contrary, she almost sounded like a mother
watching over her child as it grows.
However―――
<Page52>
"W-Wait―――what do you mean by that?"
I'm finding it a little hard to accept being told that
humans can't live without chasing after pleasure...
<Page53>
"It's not like there's anything wrong with it. It's
what made you people the dominant species on the planet
today. From the planet's standpoint, a lifeform that
searches for meaning in its own existence is an
extraordinary result of evolution.
It's certainly something that the planet itself never
thought of."
<Page54>
"Anyway#.
For bloodsuckers of the True Ancestors type like
myself, blood is the highest grade of food that
provides such secondary metaphysical benefits.
However, if my only objective is to simply 'remain
active', then I have no need to consume human blood at
all."
<Page55>
"In other words... for vampires like True Ancestors,#
blood is used more for satiating our 
hunger than anything else...
But you said that you hate sucking blood, right?
Ah, I got it! All humans have their individual likes
and dislikes when it comes to food―――Could it be
that you just hate the taste of blood?"
<Page56>
Having hit upon a convincing revelation, I can't help
but blurt it out.
However, Arcueid frowns as though something is weighing
on her.
<Page57>
"I don't know... the taste of blood―――#is unknown to
me."
"Hm...?"
She doesn't know what blood tastes like...?
<Page58>
"I told you before that I'm a failure of a bloodsucker,
right? I've never even tasted blood. I have no idea
what it's like.
All I know―――is that to drink someone's blood would
be to no longer recognize them as human."
Arcueid looks away from me as she mutters that#.
<Page59>
"Hey, Shiki. Hypothetically speaking, if birds and fish
had the same intelligence and lifespan as you, would
you still eat them?
Would you still consider them food and choose to eat
them despite that?"
<Page60>
"―――Well, that's..."
I―――probably would?
I don't know. But... if there were other animals of
lower intelligence, I would probably eat those first.
<Page61>
"See? That's what I mean.# That's sort of my line of
reasoning for hating blood... Well, maybe you were
right, maybe I simply don't like it. If possible, I'd
rather not look at blood at all.
But―――what if I didn't possess the same intelligence
or values as humans? Maybe then I wouldn't hesitate to
suck their blood.
That's the natural order of things: to take the lives
of others in order to survive."
<Page62>
"――――――"
I start upright in shock.
'It is not a sin to kill in order to live.'
It sounds like a natural thing for a vampire to say,
but when  says it, I can't help but be taken
aback.
I'm here to kill a vampire who thinks like that.
I'm not here to deem her an accomplice to that thought
process...
<Page63>
"Well... it's true that the natural order of things is
for animals to prey on each other to survive. But
aren't you similar to humans? Don't the laws of nature
also say it's taboo to eat your own kind?
That's why you should stop with those hypotheticals...
I don't like what-ifs.#"
<Page64>
"Really? I kinda like them.
You might not know where you're gonna end up, but in
the moment, you always feel like there's some kind of
salvation out there, right?"
<Page65>
What-ifs... huh.
In that case, what if Arcueid wasn't a vampire? Would I
not have to feel this way?
Or what if she was a monster who drank blood like the
other vampires? Then would I not be as irritated as I
am right now?
<Page66>
"What's wrong, Shiki?# Your face looks gloomy all of a
sudden.
Ah, do you need to go to the bathroom?"
"Come on... I'm weighed down by serious stuff here and
that's where your mind goes?"
<Page67>
I breathe out a sigh.
But I guess in a way, I'm saved by her carefree
attitude.
Regardless of how much thought I dedicate to it, I get
the impression that the question of whether she should
drink blood or not doesn't weigh on Arcueid's mind at
all.
<Page68>
"That's right... I guess at the end of the day, it's
none of my business."
<Page69>
"Geez, what are you mumbling about over there?
It's not fair to hide things from me, Shiki!"
Arcueid is once again growling at me like an indignant
cat.
<Page70>
"I'm not hiding anything from you.
If anything,  the one hiding things from . Or
at least, you certainly seem to have fun talking about
things I don't understand all the time."
<Page71>
"Having fun?―――Well, you're not wrong."
"Oh, so you really did enjoy seeing me at my wit's end.
Do you just like messing with me, or is it more the
thrill of holding all the cards?
Well, I guess it doesn't matter either way. I'm a
totally different organism after all."
<Page72>
"I-It's not like that at all...!
I've been completely forthcoming in all my
conversations with you.
If you feel like you're in the dark, isn't that down to
you not asking me any questions, rather than me
refusing to answer them...?"
<Page73>
She hits me where it hurts...
It's true that I consciously avoid asking Arcueid
questions.
<Page74>
As a human being, I'm terrified of wading any further
into the world of vampires.
And as Tohno Shiki, I want to hold on to the idea that
I can still turn back, even now.
<Page75>
However. After last night, I'm certain I've crossed a
threshold―――There's no going back to the safety I
once knew. And now that I've come this far, there are
things that I need to know.
<Page76>
"Alright then―――so you'll answer me, no matter what
I ask?"
"Yeah. We're a team after all."
<Page77>
Well, she asked for it. I guess I'll start grilling her
on things I'm still not clear on.
Starting with the main question... the one she keeps
avoiding.
<Page78>
The true identity of our enemy.
I should use this chance to find out what kind of
person they are.
<Page79>
"Then let me ask you.
Arcueid, just what kind of vampire is your enemy
anyway? You must have some sort of relationship with
them if you've gone to this length to chase after them,
right?"
"Well―――that topic――"
<Page80>
"What? Didn't we  agree to not hide anything from
each other?"
<Page81>
"We did, but don't get upset when you hear the answer.
I only recently discovered that the vampire is lurking
in this city, so I haven't even had a chance to see his
current form yet.
I don't know what form the enemy has taken this
time―――#whether he's a man or a woman, or even if
he's a child or an adult."
<Page82>
"Well... what about his special traits?
I mean, Vlov had a superpower, right? Doesn't our
target have something special like that?"
<Page83>
"There's no way of knowing until we can see him up
close.
The enemy I'm after isn't that powerful of a Dead
Apostle, but I can't predict what his strong point will
be this time, or what form he's taken."
<Page84>
"Yeah... I guess you could say that his adaptability is
his special trait. All I can say for sure is that there
are signs of him in this city."
<Page85>
"........."
Arcueid isn't lying.
But I get the feeling she isn't exactly telling me the
whole truth either.
For example―――
<Page86>
"So... we won't know what his traits are until we find
him...# Alright, I buy that. It makes perfect sense.
But you at least know his name, right?"
"His―――name..."
"Yeah, his name."
<Page87>
Arcueid silently hangs her head.
It seems like she has some reason she can't tell me his
name, and it's eating her up inside...
At least, that's what I thought.
<Page88>
"―――His name―――"
A shiver runs down my spine.
There's so much ice in her words that it feels like our
surroundings have been frozen solid.
<Page89>
"You want to know his name, Shiki?"
There is no sign of her hiding the truth.
<Page90>
"His name is Michael. Michael Roa Valdamjong. He is a
human turned vampire, a run-of-the-mill Dead Apostle."
Her beautiful lips move, but she does not look up.
All that I can sense from her is raw, blood-curdling
hatred.
<Page91>
"Arcueid, you―――"
"―――――"
Arcueid's shoulders are trembling.
She looks like she's struggling to suppress the
emotions raging within her.
<Page92>
"I'm sorry for asking you something stupid...
Telling me his name is more than enough. I'll see the
rest for myself after we hunt him down."
<Page93>
Arcueid shakes her head slightly.
It's as if she's saying that she can't forget it so
easily.
<Page94>
Time passes, neither of us saying a word.
<Page95>
"Sorry, Shiki.
That was shameful, huh. Seems like I can't keep my cool
when I say his name."
<Page96>
Arcueid apologizes with her head still hanging.
This temperate appearance isn't like her at all.
<Page97>
"You don't have to worry about it. Even if you feel bad
about it, I'm actually a little relieved. It was
honestly very human of you."
"R-Really? How so?"
<Page98>
"Well. You hate this person so much that you're hunting
him down, and only allow yourself to refer to him as
'the enemy' because you're worried about letting your
emotions get the better of you, right?
I can empathize with that way more than I can the idea
of you going around coldly exterminating vampires like
it's just a job.
If I'd known you had your reasons, I'd have―――"
<Page99>
I was about to say 'lent you a hand' but stopped
halfway.
I've been claiming that I'm only helping Arcueid in
order to protect this city. To finish that sentence
would be to contradict the excuse I continue to cling
to.
<Page100>
"Anyway, that's all the questions I have. Let's eat
while it's still hot.
This sort of food tastes pretty dire once it gets
cold."
<Page101>
"Yeah...
Though, I have to say it doesn't taste that great to
begin with? Your palate may be, well, ."
The princess averts her gaze, as though to avoid saying
out loud exactly how boorish my tastes are.
I'm sure we just weren't feeling this menu today.
That's all. I maintain that there are still times when
a burger really hits the spot.
