―――With the conversation we had at sunset weighing
on my mind, I returned to the school.
In hindsight, Arcueid was acting a little strange the
last time we were here.
<Page2>
Compared to everything else that's happened today, this
school building seems so insignificant.
Nobody hangs around by the school at night. It might
just be the perfect place to be alone.
<Page3>
There're no signs of people; not even a single sound
can be heard.
The lights are turned off, and the school building is
as silent as the grave.
"...No,# there's something..."
And yet, I can feel  is there in the building.
The scent carried by the wind brushes across my neck,
sending a shiver down my spine.
<Page4>
"...Go on, Shiki. Go in."
It would be a waste of time to hesitate.
I enter the school building through the window where I
cut the line earlier.
<Page5>
――――There's no one on the first floor.
――――#I feel pins and needles on the back of my neck.
――――I go up to the second floor.
<Page6>
There's no one here.
There's no one here.
There's no one... here.
However.
There's something slimy on my back.
I feel the touch of something weighing on me, cold but
soft, like the belly of a snake.
<Page7>
"―――――Who's there?!"
I whirl around.
And there...
"Huh――――?"
<Page8>
A piercing sound.
The next moment.
My chest is cut open.
Blood flows out. The scar on my chest reopens.
Suddenly, a knife pierces my chest from behind.
Penetrating me like a stake driving through a vampire's
chest.
<Page9>
"Ah―――――――"
Slipping, my body falls to the ground.
――――I don't understand.
My consciousness fades.
At the very last moment.
The scene of some distant summer's day flashes before
my eyes.
