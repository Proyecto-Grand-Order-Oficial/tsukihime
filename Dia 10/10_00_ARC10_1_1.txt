I arrive at the front gate.
I chose a more roundabout route to avoid being seen, so
it took me a little while to get here.
Arcueid is... ah, there she is.
<Page2>
"Sorry to keep you waiting. We'd better get a move on
though, Arcueid. Kohaku-san might spot us if we stick
around by the mansion."
"Huh? Ah, yeah. I guess we'd better get going."
Compared to her attitude earlier, her reply lacks
vigor.
<Page3>
"What's up with you? You're acting weird.
Did something happen  while you were waiting for
me?"
<Page4>
"...No, not really."
I'd emphasized the word 'again' when I asked, but
judging from Arcueid's absent-minded response, she
didn't pick up on it.
<Page5>
"...Are you not feeling well because it's light out
right now?
There's no need to force yourself to walk around. If it
hurts, then we should call this off―――"
<Page6>
"Hmm, no, my body feels fine. It's just that looking at
this wall reminded me of what happened yesterday."
"What happened yesterday... you mean when you waited
all that time for me at the park?"
Arcueid nods meekly in confirmation.
<Page7>
"Last night I went barreling over this wall at full
tilt and then snuck inside your room... It feels so
hard to believe, now that I look back on it.
Why was I so angry? If it was just that single
promise... I couldn't even tell you how many promises
people have broken up to now."
Arcueid folds her arms in deep thought, unable to come
up with an answer.
<Page8>
"Aha, of course―――I should just ask you.
You always talk down to me and call me an idiot, so you
should have no problem answering a simple question like
this, right?"
<Page9>
"Hey now..."
If Arcueid herself doesn't even know why she was mad, I
don't see how I'm supposed to be able to work it out. I
have no idea what goes on in that head of hers.
But if I had to hazard a guess――――
C:> It's because you're selfish.
C:> It's because you want to take revenge on me.
C:> It's because you're a vampire.
