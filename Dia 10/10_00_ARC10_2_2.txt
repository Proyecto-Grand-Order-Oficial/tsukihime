"Well...
Isn't it because you want to take revenge on me?"
"Revenge? Me? On you?"
<Page2>
"...I mean, I did kill you once after all.
You may have forgiven me after I helped fight against
Vlov, but it's not as though my efforts there were
enough to make you whole. It's sort of like I've paid
off the principal, but not the interest..."
<Page3>
"Hm? It's fine as long as you paid back what you
borrowed, right?"
"......"
<Page4>
In truth, I haven't even done that.
I killed Arcueid, and then served as her bodyguard
afterward.
<Page5>
But then on top of that, she took my throwaway words to
heart and protected this city for me.
...In other words, I feel like I haven't even begun to
repay her.
<Page6>
"Well... Right, consider how it all makes you feel.
You get pissed off when you think about the time you
were killed, right?
You must be like, 'This can't be forgiven, you'll pay
for this!'"
<Page7>
"Hmm... I can't say I've never thought about getting
payback... I mean, Shiki, you haven't shown up to see
me on time even . I'm still not over that, you
know."
<Page8>
She's like this just because I was late ?
The fact she's actually toyed with the idea of getting
payback makes me shudder.
I'll arrive on time from now on, even if it kills me.
<Page9>
"W-Well, considering that I'd given you grounds to be
angry, you must have hated me at least a little over
it, right?"
"Hated you? ...Yeah, you could be right.
I've never talked with anyone like this before, so I
don't really know..."
Arcueid looks down, her expression pensive.
<Page10>
"Well...
I wonder if you hate me, Shiki..."
I'm completely blindsided by her question.
<Page11>
"――――――#D-"
It was so sudden that I almost stopped thinking, but I
remember we're still at the front gate.
The sun is shining brightly overhead, and I'm already
on guard for surprise attacks after my rude awakening.
And so―――
<Page12>
"Don't ask me such stupid things. I don't like or hate
you.
Besides, what would you have done if I  told you
that I hated you? Would you have let me go?"
"Hm? In that case, I would have made you cooperate by
force."
<Page13>
"You see? Then it's irrelevant whether or not I dislike
you.
We separate our feelings from our objectives. That's
what it means to work together, right?"
<Page14>
Great. It seems that my explanation made it through to
her.
Arcueid normally takes a much more rational view on
things.
If she's asking me questions like that, then she must
have been really furious last night.
<Page15>
...So be it.
I guess I'll do my best to indulge her today, so long
as I don't have to put my life in any danger doing
so...
