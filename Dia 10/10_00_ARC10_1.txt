<Page1>
...I wonder if someone left the window open.
I can hear the small birds chirping outside.
<Page2>
The cool breeze brushes against my cheek.
The faint light of the sun dances across my eyelids.
My surroundings are imbued with a serene sense of
peace.
As I bask in the morning's warm welcome―――
I pick up my glasses from the nightstand and put them
on, my hands moving on autopilot.
<Page3>
...I see.
Seems like I fell asleep right after talking with
Akiha.
My joints are still a bit heavy, but I feel a lot
better than I did last night.
<Page4>
"―――Alright."
I let out a short rallying cry to psych myself up.
Opening my eyes, I greet the brisk morning.
<Page5>
"Ah. You're finally awake, you little punk."
However...
When I open my eyes, I see Arcueid's face right in
front of me.
<Page6>
"――――――"
My train of thought is totally derailed.
My mind is so blank it's as though my brain has turned
into tofu.
My mouth forgets how to even breathe and seizes up.
<Page7>
Seriously, I have absolutely no idea what's going on.
All I know is that Arcueid is in front of me,
that this is my room,
that the time is just past nine in the morning,
and that to top it all off, she hasn't even taken her
boots off before getting on my bed.
<Page8>
"Y-Y-You..."
"You liar. You promised that you would come yesterday."
<Page9>
Maybe it's because she's in a very bad mood, but
Arcueid's red eyes have lost their natural beauty.
―――No, that's not right.
Now that I'm up close and personal, I can feel their
beauty more vividly than ever before.
<Page10>
Arcueid is glaring steadily at me.
Her face is... really close.
<Page11>
So close that I can sense her breathing, her body heat,
even the smoothness of her skin#.
Her frame hangs over my fallen body.
A mounted position, in martial arts terms.
<Page12>
"H-Hold on, Arcueid.
Why are you here in my room first thing in the
morning...?!"
<Page13>
I try to keep my voice as low as possible while I yell
at her.
If I raise my voice and Hisui enters the room, it will
all be over for me.
Even without a full handle on the situation, I can, at
the very least, deduce that much.
<Page14>
"Fo-For now just get off me...!
Entering a person's room as you please and straddling
them while they're asleep, that's a human rights
violation! What are you, a home invader?!"
<Page15>
"What's with your attitude? The only reason I'm here is
because  broke  promise.
Where do you get off, keeping people waiting while you
yourself are happily snoozing away?"
<Page16>
Arcueid casts a sullen scowl at me.
...A promise... that's right, I made a promise.
I'd made a promise to meet up with her last night,
but... I broke it, didn't I?
<Page17>
"――――"
I finally grasp the situation.
I understand the reason behind Arcueid's anger.
<Page18>
But even so, that doesn't justify her behavior.
I honestly can't believe that she leapt straight past
'I'll give him a piece of my mind when I see him
tonight' to 'I'll break into his room'.
Seeing as how the window's open, that's probably the
route she used to sneak her way in.
<Page19>
"...I see. I did break my promise, so I can't deny that
I'm at fault there. But breaking into someone's house
because they didn't keep a promise is totally
unwarranted."
"But this isn't your house."
Arcueid issues a flat rebuttal.
<Page20>
"And besides, I was much angrier earlier.
I waited for hours and hours, and when I realized that
you'd reneged on our promise like that, even I was
surprised by how furious it made me.
I told myself that I wasn't going to take this lying
down. I was going to march over here, pin you down, and
tear your head clean off. No simple apology would earn
my forgiveness."
<Page21>
"That was a state of mind that I had never experienced
before.
I tried to get myself to calm down, but the more I
thought about it, the more pissed off I got, and my
fury just burned hotter and hotter.
Can you understand how it feels to be mired in a
bottomless swamp of grievances, the sort where lashing
out only causes you to sink deeper and deeper? I was
terrified to think about who I might become."
<Page22>
I wonder if she still feels that way, because her red
eyes are brimming with a mixture of discontent,
protest, and rage―――all directed squarely at me.
"...Ah. Yeah, that sounds unbearable."
Nodding along with her to feign attention, I stealthily
check that my neck is indeed still intact.
<Page23>
"I know, right? And so, I couldn't take it anymore and
snuck inside, but you were asleep so I decided to at
least wait for you to wake up. I wanted to hear
whatever you might have to say for yourself, after all.
But Shiki, you were taking  to actually wake up.
I didn't have anything else to do though, so I just
watched your face for a while as you slept."
<Page24>
"...Yeah. Your sleeping face was peaceful, almost
scarily so.
You were as still as the grave, and I started getting a
little worried that you weren't going to wake up
again."
<Page25>
".... If you were that worried, you should have
just woken me up.
Though, now it's my turn to be anxious, what with
having you here all of a sudden."
<Page26>
"But it felt like it would be such a shame to wake you
up.
...I don't know what I look like when I'm asleep, but I
got the feeling that if I could sleep the same way you
did, it'd make me happy. I spent the entire time I was
watching you wondering why it was that you looked so
peaceful.
I found that doing so was the only thing that could
soothe those boiling emotions I had felt. It was only
after I'd calmed down that you woke up."
<Page27>
"So... you're telling me that you've been here since
last night?"
<Page28>
"Yeah. Some of the other residents came by a couple of
times, but I hid myself whenever they did so we're
good.
There was also a girl who came to wake you up a minute
ago, but I didn't like her so I turned her away."
Arcueid lets out a carefree laugh.
<Page29>
"Hold on, what do you mean by turned her away―――"
"Relax, I didn't do anything violent. I mentioned
before that vampires possess the Mystic Eyes of
Enchantment, right?
I suggested to that girl that you had already gone to
school, and made sure she wouldn't remember anything
about me being here either."
<Page30>
"Made sure she wouldn't remember? Arcueid..."
She really does just do whatever she feels like.
...Well, even so, it seems like she tried to respect my
family situation in her own way.
<Page31>
"I get the picture now.
...And also, I'm sorry about yesterday, Arcueid.
It's not... something I can simply apologize for, but
from now on, I'll never break another promise again.
You have my word."
<Page32>
I make this declaration while staring Arcueid directly
in the face.
<Page33>
"Do you regret it?"
"I do. Moreover, I now know how terrifying your
retribution can be."
<Page34>
Still lying flat on the bed, I raise both arms in a
gesture of surrender.
I'm not sure where that displeased attitude of hers
went, but Arcueid nods, seemingly satisfied with my
answer.
<Page35>
At long last, Arcueid gets off the bed.
<Page36>
"...But still, I can't believe that you'd get up on a
bed with your boots on.
Do you have any idea how difficult it is to wash
footprints out of sheets?"
<Page37>
I pull myself upright, complaining.
Arcueid watches me from the center of the room as I
slowly haul myself out of bed.
"...Um. What are you doing?"
<Page38>
"What do you mean? I'm waiting for you to get changed.
It's not like you can go out in those clothes, right?"
<Page39>
"Well yeah, it would be pretty shameless to go
wandering around in my pajamas―――
Wait, what did you just say, Arcueid?"
<Page40>
"Yeah, I thought it would be nice to spend the entire
day with you today.
You have to make it up to me after breaking your
promise, right?"
<Page41>
Arcueid says it like it's the most natural thing in the
world.
The whole day... in other words, she wants me to skip
school and go out with her...?!
<Page42>
"What are you talking about? I have school, you
know..."
"Huh? You said you regret it, and yet you're choosing
school over me?"
<Page43>
"―――."
She's got me there.
I glance at the clock.
The time is just past nine in the morning.
<Page44>
Even if I were to leave for school right this second,
I'd still be late. Plus, I  keep Arcueid waiting all
night.
And besides... if I'm honest, this sounds way more fun.
<Page45>
"Fine, I'll go out with you today.
But even if we go out to the city right now, we aren't
likely to find any clues in the middle of the day, are
we?"
"Hmm? What are you worrying about that for?
I mean, all we're doing is going for a walk around the
city, so it doesn't matter whether it's daytime or
not."
<Page46>
"Hmm? What, weren't we going to search for vampires to
make up for the work we didn't do last night?"
<Page47>
"Yeah, we'll look for them once night falls, obviously.
But having you help out all day seems a little rough,
so I thought it would be nice to relax, at least while
it's still light out."
"...That does sound reasonable, but when you say that
we're just going for a walk, you mean..."
<Page48>
I know we've already spent a good deal of time walking
around at night together, but isn't what she's
describing now awfully close to what people might
consider a date?
<Page49>
A vampire like Arcueid probably doesn't think of it
like that, and is simply asking me to take her
somewhere interesting, but... is this for real?
Am I really going to spend all day just hanging out
with her, no vampire slaying attached?
<Page50>
"What's wrong, Shiki? Your face is red."
"―――――."
Flustered, I hide my face with my hands and look away
from Arcueid.
"Hm?"
<Page51>
...Well, I've been alone with her plenty of times
before.
But each time was in the midst of a crisis, where the
fact that we were allies working toward a common goal
took precedence over the fact that we were a man and a
woman.
That's why―――despite being aware of just how
beautiful Arcueid is, I'd been able to put it out of my
mind.
<Page52>
However...
If I simply pass the time with her with no overarching
danger or objective, I might start to notice things
that I shouldn't―――
<Page53>
"Shiki? Hey, are you actually going to go to school
after all...?"
"...As if. I said I'd go out with you, didn't I? I'm
not about to break my promise again. I don't know what
you have in store for me, but I can't imagine just
walking around the city will pose much of a problem."
<Page54>
"! Yeah, thanks Shiki!
In that case, let's get moving!"
"........."
What is she thanking me for?
Arcueid bounds over to the window that I'd suspected
she broke in through.
<Page55>
"Hold on a minute. I'll get changed right away, so stay
there and look outside or something."
"Huh? Did you call me?"
<Page56>
"Yeah, I did, but I didn't! Sorry for jerking you
around, but you can head on outside. I'll be right
there."
"Alright, I'll wait for you by the front gate. I've
already waited long enough, so don't make me wait any
longer, Shiki."
<Page57>
Arcueid makes a light tapping sound as she exits
through the window, a feline grace and fluidity to her
movements.
I hear the trees in the garden rustling as she leaps
from limb to limb.
<Page58>
Moving through the treetops rather than on the ground,
she disappears from view as nimbly as a cat might.
If she can move around like that, sneaking into my room
must have been a breeze for her.
<Page59>
"...This is no time to be admiring her.
I also have to get out of here without being seen by
Hisui somehow."
<Page60>
I change out of my pajamas into some casual clothes.
Today's a weekday, after all. I'll be taken into
protective custody if I go wandering around the city in
my uniform when I'm supposed to be in school.
<Page61>
I crack the door, make sure there's nobody hanging
around the hallway, and make my move.
I can't risk going through the lobby, so I use a window
in one of the rooms on the first floor to get out into
the yard.
