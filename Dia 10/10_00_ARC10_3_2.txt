<Page1>
I wonder if I'm even sane.
No, I am.
There's no doubt in my mind as to our destination.
This overwhelming desire has been smoldering in my
chest ever since that day we fought against Vlov.
<Page2>
"Please lend me your hand, my dear princess. I shall
guide you to the ballroom of elites, a place befitting
a sheltered girl such as yourself who knows naught of
common sense."
"Oh my?!"
I bow reverently and hold out my hand.
<Page3>
Arcueid blinks in surprise.
"Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it!
I can't wait to see what kind of wonderful place you'll
take me to, Shiki!"
With a smile full of anticipation and gratitude, she
grabs my hand in return.
<Page4>
With that being said,
I wasn't expecting us to hold hands the entire trip.
The show I put on earlier was only intended to create
the atmosphere of inviting her to a ballroom dance.
<Page5>
We've almost reached our destination.
All that's left now is to slip away from the main drag
and into the empty back alleys―――
<Page6>
"What? Is something wrong, Shiki?"
"No, it's just that people sure are staring at us a
lot.
I feel like we didn't attract nearly this much
attention during the night."
<Page7>
"Well, not much we can do about that.
My natural camouflage is wearing thin at the moment. If
I were alone, I wouldn't stick in people's minds even
during the day, but right now, I'm here with you.
Ah. Is that a problem by any chance?"
<Page8>
"Depends, what would happen if you dialed that natural
camouflage of yours all the way up?"
"Hmm... it would probably be enough to make me look
invisible, even to you."
"Then stay as you are. This was more an issue of me
being narrow-minded."
"Huh?"
<Page9>
...So that's what was behind it.
Arcueid's the reason why people have been gawking at us
the whole time.
<Page10>
In that case, it's fine.
I've known from the moment I met her that she's the
sort of beauty you might only catch sight of once in a
blue moon.
I have to admit, I get a bit of a kick out of all these
passersby staring so enviously at Arcueid.
However.
<Page11>
"Let's hurry, Arcueid. I want you all to myself today."
This time, I can't control my monopolistic urges, err,
I mean curiosity.
Leading a bewildered Arcueid by the hand, I hurry
toward our destination.
<Page12>
"Behold, the ballroom of the city."
"Is this just some bizarre fetish?!"
<Page13>
.
I haven't even had a chance to fully explain myself yet
and she's already hurling some ridiculous abuse my way.
<Page14>
I may be able to turn a deaf ear, but the pros that
frequent this alley would consider those words to be
slander, my dear princess.
<Page15>
"Now now, let's not get ahead of ourselves,
Arcueid-kun.
Just what do you think I'm about to ask of you here?"
<Page16>
"You're gonna ask me to change into my dress, right?
After that, you're probably going to turn this into a
photo shoot."
"Seriously? What're you even basing that conclusion
on?"
"I can see it in your eyes!"
<Page17>
"."
I doubt that alone was enough to give the game away.
Someone must have tipped her off beforehand.
Though... there aren't many people out there who would
know about this place...
<Page18>
"Well, I just happened to know about this place.
While I was browsing the internet before bed, I
discovered that they shot a film here about a year ago.
Amateur photographers have been coming here to take
glamour shots of up-and-coming models ever since."
"You're talking about cosplayers, right? I know what
they are. There's no need to be coy about it."
<Page19>
"I'm not being coy. I'm just trying to convey the
honest truth―――"
<Page20>
Uh-oh.
Something that would have turned my head to mincemeat
just slammed into the wall behind me. And I do mean
.
<Page21>
"I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that~☆
Did you say something stupid just now?"
"Nope, nothing."
<Page22>
"―――And so?
What exactly was it that possessed you to put on that
song and dance just to bring me to a place like this?"
<Page23>
Arcueid is glaring daggers at me.
But her gaze doesn't appear to be tinged with scorn or
disappointment.
Instead, it seems she's upset with the underhanded
tactics I used to bring her here.
I fucked up.
If I'd known that this is how things would play out, I
would've been more upfront with my request.
<Page24>
"Sorry. I was wondering if I could get a closer look at
the dress you wore when fighting Vlov..."
<Page25>
"I'm sorry, but please show me the dress you wore when
fighting Vlov again, just one more time..."
<Page26>
And so, I confessed my true intentions.
<Page27>
"―――Geez.
I'd have preferred it if you just said that from the
get-go.
I was this close to getting my revenge here and now."
Leaving aside the question of what exactly she meant by
'revenge'...
"So you're going to wear it for me?"
<Page28>
"If that's what you want to see, then sure.
Could you turn around and close your eyes for me?
It's been five days since I came up with this recipe,
so even though I remember it, it might take a few
seconds."
<Page29>
I waste no time in doing as she says.
I wonder if her embarrassment stems from simply wearing
the dress,
or from the fact that she lost to Vlov while wearing
it.
Whatever the case may be, I'm not about to interject
with any of my musings on the subject after seeing her
make such a sweet face.
<Page30>
"Alright, that was way more fun than I thought it would
be!"
<Page31>
Arcueid's mood has changed dramatically, and she's now
in high spirits.
Even though she started off a little shy, I'd say that
based on the rather self-satisfied look she's got on
her face now, she may well have what it takes to be a
model.
<Page32>
"Yeah, I was able to take my fair share of photos.
I don't think I've ever made such heavy use of my phone
as a camera before.
It's not often in my life that I'll get to see such a
pretty dress in person, so I got a little carried
awa―――#?!"
<Page33>
Wait, no, no, no!
My photos... they're all out of focus...!
<Page34>
"Ah. I forgot to mention this, but I don't think that I
or my clothes are going to show up well in photos.
I mean, you've heard that vampires don't show up in
mirrors, right?"
<Page35>
"... I have, but...
But we're talking about digital photos here! Ones and
zeroes! Shouldn't that be different from a mirror?!"
<Page36>
"A photo is no different from a mirror in that what it
shows isn't mediated by human perception, right?
A , on the other hand, would definitely have
recorded me as I appeared."
<Page37>
She's talking about a painting, isn't she...
That's quite the tall hurdle.
<Page38>
"Are you satisfied with my debut?
If so, then I think it's my turn to make a request."
"Sure, but what do you have in mind?"
<Page39>
Her heart really does change on a dime, huh.
Arcueid takes a firm grip on my right arm.
<Page40>
". I just thought of a place I want to go."
Grinning broadly, she does the unthinkable.
<Page41>
"――――?!"
I'm suddenly reliving the nightmare I experienced a few
days ago, ping-ponging between the walls of the
buildings on either side as we fly upwards.
Except―――this time, there's no bouncing off the
walls.
This madwoman just leaps vertically up into the air,
taking us higher than any of the surrounding
buildings――――!
<Page42>
We brazenly land on the rooftop of a building in broad
daylight.
Fortunately, or perhaps unsurprisingly, there's no one
on the rooftop, and so our arrival didn't cause any
commotion, but...
<Page43>
"Arcueid, could you at least warn me before
flying―――"
<Page44>
"Right, thank you for waiting, my dear guest.
Welcome to our secret banquet hall."
"――――――"
<Page45>
...I'm at a loss for words.
Arcueid lets go of my arm, a cool yet delighted smile
on her face. Her revenge is complete.
If this is supposed to be a banquet hall, it could
really do with someplace to sit.
<Page46>
"...Shit.
You're not the type to let someone else have the last
laugh, are you?"
<Page47>
"Bingo! I mean, I'd never have caught you if I weren't,
right?"
"―――#I-I guess.
That's true, actually."
<Page48>
She was so stunning that I could only eke out a few
words in reply.
...Shit, what was that just now?
I really don't know what's come over me.
Her reply was totally unnecessary. That carefree smile
alone would capture the heart of any ordinary man.
<Page49>
"What made you decide on the rooftop, though?
Are you fond of high places?"
<Page50>
"Well, last time we were here it was nighttime, and the
city was on fire.
I wanted to see the city as it normally is, together
with you.
Plus, you seem to like places without many people
around. There's nobody to disturb us up here, see?"
<Page51>
"――――――"
There's no coming back from a surprise attack like
that.
All of the feelings that had been boiling in me as a
result of our meteoric rise to the rooftops are drowned
out by a different set of emotions.
I find my hands being drawn to her, reaching out to
touch her# white body.
Acting on something other than reason, I begin to draw
closer to Arcueid as if it were the most natural thing
in the world.
"Pardon me. But this area is private property."
"?!"
Suddenly, I am greeted by an unfamiliar third party.
<Page52>
"W-W-Where the hell did you come from?!"
"What do you mean? I've been here the whole time.
Senpai, you really are as dim-witted as you look."
"Huh?"
<Page53>
"Apologies. My tongue must have slipped.
You must have really bad eyesight. Please take a closer
look at your surroundings."
<Page54>
I dutifully cast my eyes around the rooftop.
...Well, what do you know. A small tent has been set up
in the lee of the water tower that sits atop the
building.
Was this girl inside that tent?
<Page55>
"So you've finally noticed. I'm staggered by how
oblivious you are.
Are your senses starting to fade?
Or were you simply too engrossed in your date with your
lover here to notice?"
<Page56>
Could you stop with the bad-mouthing? What will I do if
she gets carried away?
No, that's not what's important right now.
<Page57>
"Why do you have a tent in a place like this?
Actually, do I know you?"
I have no idea why this kid I don't even recognize is
calling me 'Senpai'.
<Page58>
"We went to middle school together. Kagu Middle.
Although you were a third-year and I was a first-year.
We didn't know each other. We only passed by one
another in the infirmary a few times."
<Page59>
...It seems likes she's telling the truth.
Kagu Middle. That's an abbreviation of Kaguraoka Middle
School: the school that I attended.
<Page60>
"But if that's the case, shouldn't you be in school
right now..."
"I'm taking time off school for personal reasons. It's
tough staying at home though, so I'm staying here as a
NEET.
Right as I was forgetting all about this mundane world,
a hopeless senpai barges in dragging a pretty lady in a
dress, and now I've just about had it."
<Page61>
"――――――"
So she's one of those shut-ins that I've heard about.
Though I have to say, this seems more like a shut-out?
Is this the urban version of secluding yourself on a
mountain?
<Page62>
"I'm the one who should be asking why you're here. This
building belongs to us, after all. I'll report you."
<Page63>
"."
I can't see how things could have gone any worse.
Even if we were to run away now, she would still know
our names and faces, and it's an undeniable fact that
we're trespassing.
<Page64>
Somehow...
I don't think trying to explain that I was carried here
against my will by this fickle, sore-loser princess
would get me out of it.
<Page65>
"Hmm. You're going to report us?"
"...No, I just felt like saying it.
That stupid-looking grin on his face was getting on my
nerves, that's all.
I haven't seen anything, so please finish your business
on the building next door. I don't need you sticking
around here disturbing the peace."
<Page66>
The young girl heads back toward her tent.
"Sorry for causing trouble!
Also, can I get your name?!"
<Page67>
I call out to her back.
The young girl stops in her tracks and says―――
"Mio. Saiki Mio.
It's fine if you don't remember it."
Hmm, I feel like I've heard that surname before.
<Page68>
In the end, we didn't jump over to the neighboring
building, and so our private ball came to a close.
Reason being that we realized we ought to be  the
buildings, where all the shops are, rather than
standing around on top of them.
<Page69>
Having an impartial observer point out just how flirty
we were getting may have also contributed somewhat to
this decision.
<Page70>
It's only been two hours since then.
In order to satiate Arcueid's curiosity, we ended up
visiting every store in the vicinity of the station.
<Page71>
All of the attractions here may have been familiar to
me, but to Arcueid, they must have seemed new and
exciting.
Not only did she seem to thoroughly enjoy herself the
entire time we were hopping in and out of the
department stores, but we didn't run into a single
major issue.
