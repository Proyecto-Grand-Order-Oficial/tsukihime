<Page1>
The hands of the clock steadily advance.
The two hours we've spent in the park passed in the
blink of an eye.
<Page2>
"―――."
My body has long since settled down, and there are no
more signs of other people.
Human and vampire alike, the time has come for night
dwellers to make their move.
<Page3>
"Arcueid, isn't it about time we head out?"
"Yeah, I think we're good to go."
Despite agreeing with me, it doesn't seem like Arcueid
is fully on board.
<Page4>
".... You've been acting strange for a while now,
Arcueid.
Did something happen?"
"―――It's not like that.
It's just that the shadowy Dead you told me about has
been bothering me a bit."
<Page5>
Arcueid seems visibly dispirited.
Just as I was about to call out to ask what's on her
mind―――
<Page6>
"Ah, that reminds me, Shiki.
Yesterday, I got hit on by a guy here."
"――――Pardon?"
A complete 180.
She really does turn on a dime.
<Page7>
"Sorry. I don't get what you're trying to say."
"Like I said! While I was waiting for you here
yesterday, a guy called out to me!"
<Page8>
"...No, I understand what happened, but... weren't you
agonizing over that shadowy Dead just a second ago?"
<Page9>
"I was. That's what made me suddenly remember!
In the same way you were attacked, I was also suddenly
greeted by another man!"
<Page10>
"...Ah, I see. Well, good for you.
It's true that you're a real beauty, on the outside at
least. Any man with proper sense and admirable courage
would at least call out to you."
<Page11>
"So I was right. I also thought that they were an enemy
at first, but you mentioned it before, right? That I
stand out just by existing.
Because of that I observed his behavior for a bit, and
concluded that he was just a normal human being."
<Page12>
"He really was walking on a knife's edge, wasn't he? I
mean, thanks to a certain somebody, I was a little bit
irritated that night.#"
<Page13>
"...Hold on a second.
I don't want to believe it, but that guy who hit on
you, did you..."
<Page14>
"No, I didn't do anything to him. We just talked for a
bit, then I made him forget about me afterward.
...Well, if I hadn't remembered what you said to me,
things might have turned out differently."
"I see. I'm proud of you, Arcueid. To think even you
possess that level of discretion."
<Page15>
"Of course.# You're the only one that can really make me
angry. There's no one else who has both killed and
saved me before after all."
"――――――"
A vibrant voice, filled with trust.
I've lost count at this point of how many times she's
sprung that smile on me.
<Page16>
"I mean... well... anybody would get pissed off if they
were murdered."
I get off something resembling a retort before averting
my gaze from the merry Arcueid.
<Page17>
...One month ago.
If it weren't for the serial killings, the park would
be full of young couples and students on their way back
from a night out, even at this hour.
<Page18>
But the only people here chatting now are myself and
Arcueid.
Hunting vampires and the lines of death have taken a
back seat for the moment.
We blend into the scenery like we're natural fixtures.
<Page19>
"Ah. Hey, look."
I raise my head at the sudden call.
"What? Did something happen?"
"Yeah. Look at the clock. The time is  right."
<Page20>
Arcueid points at the park clock, a big smile on her
face.
It certainly points to ten o'clock.
<Page21>
The promised time.
A spoken promise to meet here at ten o'clock.
Last night, I failed to keep that promise, and let that
meeting slip away.
<Page22>
"―――――――"
For some reason, I'm at a loss for words.
Why does my heart feel so moved by such a trivial
thing?
Why does she seem so happy about something so
insignificant?
<Page23>
...I really don't know.
I spent all day today walking around the city with her.
At no point did I feel like Arcueid really was a
vampire.
<Page24>
"...There's something I want to ask."
――――Don't do it, Shiki.
<Page25>
"Hm?# What is it?"
"...Well, it's about you."
――――Don't do something so stupid, stop.
"Yeah, what about me?"
"...Are you really... a vampire?"
――――What kind of answer are you expecting, you
moron.
<Page26>
"Am I really a vampire? ...Shiki, how long have you
been sitting on that question for?"
"That's not it. It only popped into my head just now."
I couldn't look her in the eye as I replied.
<Page27>
".... I can't tell whether this means there's
cotton or rocks between your ears.
Anyone else would have considered that to be a grave
insult. What exactly made you ask such a thing?"
<Page28>
I have no reason to think she isn't.
But on the other hand, I've seen no hard proof that she
is.
That's why―――
<Page29>
"...I mean, you said you can't stand the sight of
blood, right? What kind of vampire is that? Even if you
say that you're a failure as a vampire, never drinking
blood has got to mean you aren't really even a vampire
at all.#"
<Page30>
―――It's not like that.
The truth is, I just don't want her to be a vampire.
<Page31>
"...You're right.
In that case, get up from the bench and come over
here."
Arcueid's voice is cold.
"........."
I dutifully stand up and walk toward her.
<Page32>
"――――"
Our gazes meet.
The distance between us is about two meters.
<Page33>
...And then.
Arcueid takes a deep breath before putting on a forced
smile.
<Page34>
"I guess you're right. I've actually thought the same.
I've wondered to myself: 'Is Arcueid Brunestud really a
vampire?'"
<Page35>
...Thank goodness.
I couldn't help myself from blurting out that question,
even knowing there was a chance that it might hurt
Arcueid.
I'm glad that she was able to take it as a joke.
<Page36>
"...I know, right? You just don't strike me as a
vampire at all."
<Page37>
"Then, how about we test it out?"
Arcueid spoke those words with a mischievous smile.
"Yeah, I guess we'd have to test―――Huh?"
<Page38>
"Let's test whether I can really suck blood or not.
If I can, will you give me a reward, Shiki?"
"Wha――――"
Arcueid walks toward me with a smile on her face,
taking step after step.
<Page39>
. #.
I hear the sound of her footsteps as she draws closer.
Both of us know that this is a joke.
But even so―――my body won't move at all.
<Page40>
"Wai――――"
I try to speak out, but I can't.
It's not Arcueid's doing―――I held my tongue of my
own accord.
<Page41>
Arcueid is getting closer.
One step. Then another.
She closes in little by little, her head gently
lowered.
I'm unable to lift even a single finger, my eyes
transfixed by her full, sensual lips――――
<Page42>
"You said that I was a failure as a vampire."
Her alluring voice reverberates inside my head.
I hear her footsteps come to a halt nearby.
"―――But the truth is, sucking blood is incredibly
easy."
I hear her voice right next to my ear.
<Page43>
I can feel her breath.
Her fingertips touch my body.
I feel her weight on my shoulders; I feel it through my
whole body.
"―――――――"
A heartbeat so strong it nearly knocks me unconscious.
<Page44>
I want her. I want her. I want her. I want her.
I desperately try to suppress my boiling emotions.
I try to hold back with every fiber of my being―――
My left arm trembles so much that my back shakes.
My right arm desperately longs to embrace her.
I want her so bad. There's no way I can hold back. Even
so, I cannot allow myself to desire this woman now.
<Page45>
I mean, everything is different.
Compared to back then, this feels stronger. More
intense.
What I want now is fundamentally different to what I
wanted then.
Killing her... isn't what I want.
It's a different impulse that's driving me mad this
time.
But I mustn't defile her heartfelt courage like this.
<Page46>
"――――――"
Gritting my teeth so hard my molars grate, I manage to
summon enough strength to hold back my seething
emotions.
My internal conflict was over in little under a second.
During that time, Arcueid didn't move at all.
<Page47>
...Suddenly, a chill runs down my spine.
This is just a joke. She's not trying to convince me of
that, but herself.
And yet, I can still feel her hot, fiery breath on my
neck.
<Page48>
"Ar―――――"
I begin to call her name, but bite my tongue.
That would be like indicating that I don't have faith
in her.
<Page49>
It's already over.
This prank will come to an end, and Arcueid will put on
her usual smile and say―――
'Just kidding, I'm not going to suck your blood after
all!'
<Page50>
"――――――"
...And yet, the weight on my shoulders shifts.
The soft sensation turns into a sharp pain.
The white fingers gripping my shoulders tremble
violently.
<Page51>
―――She's afraid.
My thoughts are clear. No fear or anything, even now.
It's only Arcueid who's trembling violently.
<Page52>
Her breathing is pained.
Even though they're so close, each breath feels so far
away.
I can't see her face.
I can feel the shaking of her body in each exhalation
that brushes across my neck.
Her breathing goes from a light whimper to heavy,
labored hyperventilation.
<Page53>
"Ar―――cueid?"
...Unable to bear it, I call out her name.
"Even though―――――it's just a joke..."
Arcueid's voice is shaky.
But the fingers on my shoulders are no longer
trembling.
<Page54>
"――――!"
I cry out in pain.
Even though I have no desire to move, my body
reflexively tries to get away from ■■.
But her claws don't let up.
They press into me, their vise-like grip refusing to
let me escape even as I try to pull away.
<Page55>
"―――I'm sorry. I went too far.
I shouldn't have mocked you, so... please, let go of
me."
"Shi――――ki."
<Page56>
Her fingers won't let go.
―――Not good. This is not good.
I must have struck a nerve.
Alarm bells ring inside my head.
I move my arm to push her away.
<Page57>
But it's too late.
It's too late no matter what I do.
How long has it been too late for?
From just now? From a mere five minutes ago? Or was it
from a day ago―――no, from the very first time we
met?
<Page58>
"―――――――――"
Her heavy breathing rises from my neck all the way to
my brain.
It's like a chemical message that floods my head with
her arousal.
<Page59>
"No―――I, can't―――"
The echoes of her instincts slip into my ear.
There's no need for her to use brute strength. With her
alluring voice alone...
<Page60>
"I just―――wanted, you―――"
My mind melts along with my entire body.
<Page61>
"―――――――――――――"
I feel it on my neck.
Her hot, frenzied breath.
In an instant―――
"――――――Ah."
My sense of reason crumbles.
<Page62>
It was a primordial fear.
Divine providence that could not be opposed.
A creature that cannot be understood.
<Page63>
Eyes, that swirl like a storm.
Teeth, spiked like a mountain range.
An overwhelming waterfall of force; something that
absolutely cannot be reasoned with.
Right now, the  that's about to sink its fangs
into my neck is not the woman that I once knew, but the
embodiment of her raw, unbridled nature.
<Page64>
As someone that escaped from the providence of the
natural world, I must now contend with something far
more primeval.
There's nothing I can do.
I can't even move my fingertips.
<Page65>
I'm about... to be eaten.
So this is what it's like to be preyed on.
A human in front of this lifeform―――
Is nothing more than a drop to be consumed―――
<Page66>
"―――!#"
With a crunch, the fangs pierce my neck.
All that's left in my mind is fear.
"[ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00]"
<Page67>
I let out a scream.
Hearing my own voice like that, for a moment, it
sounded almost pathetic.
Perhaps it's only my imagination―――
But it feels like Arcueid has stopped dead in her
tracks.
