I awake at the sound of Hisui's voice.
After what happened―――after coming back to the
mansion, I must have holed myself up in my room and
passed out.
...I breathe a sigh at the headache that reverberates
from my eyes to my brain.
Not that it bothers me much. It's a familiar feeling.
I reach over to the nightstand and put on my glasses.
<Page2>
"Shiki-sama... are you not feeling well?"
"No, it's nothing really. Good morning, Hisui."
<Page3>
I reply and get out of bed.
...I'm a little surprised at myself.
Even though I don't want to talk about anything, my
body attempts to carry on with the usual routine.
<Page4>
"Breakfast, right? I got it, I'll be there soon."
"...Understood. In that case, I shall wait for you
downstairs."
<Page5>
Hisui leaves the room, looking like she had something
else to say.
I check my phone. No mail. Today is Monday.
It's hard to believe, but it seems that after I came
back Saturday night, I slept straight through all of
Sunday. I guess the fatigue that had been building
these past few days finally caught up with me.
I change into my school uniform and head to the dining
room.
<Page6>
After having breakfast, I stop by the living room.
Akiha and Kohaku-san are there, as usual.
"Good morning."
I sink onto the sofa and stare vacantly at the clock.
<Page7>
"...Nii-san? Um, it's good that you're up early,# but
you do know that you have school today, right?"
"Hm―――? Ah, right.
I can't just skip school."
<Page8>
I completely forgot.
Having lost my sense of purpose, I'd ended up thinking
that I'd just carry on drifting through life as an
empty shell.
<Page9>
"...I have my own life to live, don't I? I may as well
go to school if I don't have anything else going on."
"Nii-san...?"
<Page10>
Akiha gives me a doubtful look.
My mind simply isn't capable of coming up with an
excuse or an explanation right now.
In the end, I leave the mansion without saying
anything.
<Page11>
The hours slip by without incident.
I aimlessly take in the lesson of whatever class this
is.
I hear the sound of the chalk scraping away.
I unconsciously jot down the formulas being hastily
scrawled across the blackboard.
<Page12>
Suddenly, I catch sight of the schoolyard through the
window.
I feel like I've done this before.
There's no one there, as you'd expect.
<Page13>
"――――――"
―――What on earth am I doing?
Why am I just sitting here, obediently attending
classes?
I can't believe I've gone back to my normal school life
instead of searching for her.
<Page14>
But... I don't have the ways or means to find her.
Now that she's erased herself from my life, there's no
possibility I'll ever see her again.
That's why, it's certain.
I've truly lost Arcueid this time―――
<Page15>
"......"
Something on my desk makes a noise.
It's nothing worth mentioning.
It was only my mechanical pencil breaking from being
gripped too hard.
