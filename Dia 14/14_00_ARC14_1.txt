<Page1>
"Shiki-sama, it's morning. Please wake up."
...I hear a familiar voice.
<Page2>
"Shiki-sama... It is imperative that you wake up.
If you are late for a second time in as many days, you
will have broken the promise you made to Akiha-sama."
<Page3>
...It's hard to tell whether there's a sense of urgency
in her voice or not.
<Page4>
"Very well. Then by your leave, I shall present today's
schedule.
This morning, you will once again be scolded by
Akiha-sama. As this is the second day in a row, I
believe that the sentence will be escalated to corporal
punishment."
<Page5>
...I'd really rather not hear any more of this
profoundly terrifying schedule...
<Page6>
"...I'm awake. I'll get up, so just hold on a sec."
I reply with the blanket still pulled over my head
before sluggishly emerging from my slumber.
<Page7>
"Good morning, Shiki-sama."
"Right, good morning."
<Page8>
Still half asleep, I respond to her greeting and put on
my glasses.
It's just after seven o'clock in the morning.
The only people here are Hisui, who had come to wake me
at the usual hour, and myself, who was actually already
awake for once.
<Page9>
"Breakfast has already been prepared.
Once you are finished changing, please come to the
dining room."
Bowing once, Hisui leaves the room.
<Page10>
"――――."
After a luxurious stretch, I get out of bed.
I change into my school uniform and tidy my desk, which
is still cluttered with notes from yesterday's study
session.
<Page11>
I open a drawer to put away some small odds and ends.
In the drawer is my knife. It has sat there unused ever
since that night.
<Page12>
The curtains sway gently.
Hisui must have opened the window. The sky outside is
refreshingly clear.
However, the breeze blowing in feels a little chilly.
<Page13>
When I first came to after the events of that night, I
was back in my own room.
It seems that Senpai carried me all the way back.
Fortunately for me, it doesn't look like Akiha or the
others even noticed I was gone.
<Page14>
One month has passed since that night.
Tohno Shiki's life is the same as it ever was.
Every now and then talking with Akiha will trigger
memories of the past I'd rather forget, but at the end
of the day, we're still brother and sister.
Even after learning the truth, nothing has changed
about the relationship we'd already built up over the
years.
<Page15>
Aside from the fact that the walkway is being repaired,
nothing much has changed at school either.
Reportedly there were no casualties of the midnight
cave-in. No injured people at the scene, no
bloodstains, no nothing. All evidence had simply
disappeared without a trace.
<Page16>
The only difference is that now there's one less
student than there used to be.
Then again, I'm the only one who even remembers that
she was ever there at all.
<Page17>
There haven't been any more of the serial killings that
had gripped the city either.
They never caught the perpetrator, so the city is still
pretty quiet at night, but in another month or so, I
expect it'll be back to business as usual.
<Page18>
As for me―――
In the end, I still have a hole in my heart that I'll
never be able to fill. Even so, I keep on living as I
did before.
<Page19>
...I'm not sure how, but I'm able to endure.
Every now and then, a memory resurfaces. But even
though I feel helpless sometimes, I don't seem to be in
any danger of losing myself just yet.
I wonder if some day I won't be able to bear it anymore
and will go insane, or if I'll eventually just get used
to it, and simply drift through life as an empty shell.
<Page20>
A person's memories don't last forever. Even if I write
things down so as not to forget them, the glorious time
we spent together... her mannerisms, the sound of her
voice, will all fade away bit by bit.
These vivid memories will someday be nothing more than
vague recollections of the past.
<Page21>
But until that time comes―――
Even though I know it's pointless, every day I go and
uphold my end of the promise we made.
<Page22>
".... Seems like autumn's almost over already."
The sky outside is breathtakingly clear.
After filling my lungs with the cool air, I close the
window.
<Page23>
School has let out for the day.
Nobody else is left in the classroom.
Even so, I won't return to the mansion until after the
sun has set.
<Page24>
A red classroom.
The burning glow of the sunset spills in through the
windows.
The deep red sun is melting away, as though sinking
into the deepest recesses of the sky.
<Page25>
"―――――"
I've been waiting like this for a long time.
And I'll keep waiting―――I'll sit here and watch the
scenery outside fade away, day after day, until the day
comes when I can no longer remember the promise that I
made to her.
<Page26>
The one promise that went unfulfilled.
'After everything is over... when we finally defeat
this vampire...
Before we part ways, can we hang out together like this
one last time?'
I'm pretty sure she'd tilted her head at me in
confusion.
<Page27>
'I was just wondering if once we're truly done with our
duties we could meet again, without there having to be
a reason for it.'
<Page28>
...I remember saying something along those lines.
She was all I could think about at the time.
Not as a colleague in a mutually beneficial
partnership―――
But as a close friend that I could make unremarkable
memories with.
I thought she'd enjoy something like that.
<Page29>
'Of course―――!
Let's come here again after everything is over, Shiki!
Even if there's no reason, I'm sure it'll be super
fun...!'
<Page30>
Her eyes had gone wide in surprise, but after that,
she'd nodded.
In this classroom, bathed in the light of the setting
sun―――
She'd made that promise with a genuine smile on her
face.
<Page31>
―――I still remember that promise.
―――I still remember that smile.
―――I still remember everything.
I can't forget.
I won't  myself to forget.
Here, in a classroom that looked like it was on fire,
we promised that we'd return. I will remember that
moment forever―――
<Page32>
"........."
The sun sinks deeper and deeper.
Only a few hours remain until this vermilion disappears
completely.
A quiet interlude before the crimson atmosphere slips
away.
A world frozen in time, both eternal and transient.
Of course, it's also possible I've already gone mad.
After all, I'm waiting for someone who will never
arrive.
Almost as though I'm desperately clinging to those
happy moments.
<Page33>
―――.
I hear the sound of something brushing against a desk.
<Page34>
I look over.
The previously closed window is now ajar.
My mind takes a second to catch up.
She's standing there next to the window, steeped in the
red light of the setting sun.
<Page35>
She doesn't move from her position by the window.
Even though she's right here in front of me―――
There is a distance between us that can never be
crossed.
<Page36>
"―――――――"
My voice won't come out.
But somehow, I feel incredibly calm.
<Page37>
"...I give up. I really  planning on disappearing
quietly, but you'd just keep waiting for me forever,
Shiki.
I couldn't leave you be,# so, well, here I am."
She smiles softly, as though embarrassed.
<Page38>
"...Well, of course I did#.
I told you I wouldn't break any more promises, didn't
I?"
"I guess you did. Thank you for keeping your promise."
<Page39>
The feeling is mutual.
I wonder if this is really happening.
Or maybe I've already lost my mind, and this is nothing
more than an illusion.
But either way, I have to thank her for granting my
wish.
<Page40>
"But, I'm sorry. This time, I'm the one who can't keep
their promise.#"
"...Why?"
<Page41>
...I'm surprised at myself.
I was able to ask her that question in a truly gentle
tone, with neither anger nor entreaty in my voice. I'm
surprised, but also... happy.
<Page42>
"...Well. I never told you the reason I was chasing
Roa, did I?
Um, the truth is... Once, a long time ago, I drank the
blood of a human. When I did, that human stole a
fraction of my power and went on to become a fearsome
Dead Apostle."
―――So, in other words...
<Page43>
"...And that man was Roa?"
"Yeah. Up until that point, I'd never experienced the
vampiric urge before. Apparently even the other True
Ancestors believed that I was the only one who didn't
have it.
But it turned out that it simply took a while for my
urges to develop."
<Page44>
"Until that happened... until I began to thirst for
blood, I didn't even know that I was a bloodsucker.
That's why―――#I didn't understand that it was
something I mustn't do."
<Page45>
...I see.
She had never been taught anything unnecessary.
As a result, she didn't even know that she was the same
as the targets she went around killing.
<Page46>
"But that doesn't excuse my actions.
With just one mistake, I ended up destroying everyone.
...That's why I vowed never to drink blood again.
But True Ancestors that have tasted blood, even if only
once, cannot stay sane unless they continue to drink
it."
"――――"
<Page47>
"...The only reason I can be here right now is because
you# were able to completely 'kill' Roa.
No matter how many times I annihilated him, only his
body would disappear―――I couldn't kill his soul."
<Page48>
"But you managed to kill his very existence.
When you did, the power that he had stolen returned to
me, and I was able to revive somehow."
<Page49>
"―――T――――hat..."
"But that's all I can do. The vampiric urges inside of
me have gotten to the point where I can't control them
anymore.
That's why――――"
<Page50>
"―――That―――doesn't matter."
"...I can't see you anymore.
I'm sorry for breaking our promise."
...That doesn't matter anymore.
I just―――#want you to stay by my side.
<Page51>
"...There's a way for you to keep that promise."
"Shiki...?"
"Suck my blood. Won't doing that solve everything?"
<Page52>
Time is the only thing that continues to flow.
Neither one of us says another word.
After a silence that felt like an eternity―――
"―――I'm really glad.
But I think I'll pass. I don't want your blood."
<Page53>
"Why? Is my blood not good enough for you?# Is there
some reason that you can't suck my blood?"
Arcueid nods her head.
<Page54>
"I can't do it... because I love you."
With a smile like a flower in full bloom, she tenderly
bids me farewell#.
<Page55>
"......"
I take a deep breath.
With all the power that I can muster, I suppress the
feelings that threaten to send me careening over the
edge.
<Page56>
I wanted to stop her.
I wanted to stop her.
I wanted to stop her.
――――I wanted to stop her, even if it meant killing
her.
But her smile was just too beautiful.
I couldn't bring myself to tarnish it with my selfish
thoughts.
<Page57>
"―――Farewell. I'm truly grateful for everything,
Shiki."
"........."
My throat is trembling so much that I can't speak.
<Page58>
Even so―――I have to say my goodbyes.
Even when I was young―――
I think I knew it was the proper way to send off
someone that was dear to me.
<Page59>
"...I'm a liar."
"Why? You kept your promise, didn't you?"
"―――I'm just a pathetic liar.
Even though... I said that I would make you happy..."
Even though I  that I would...
<Page60>
"...No, you did.
I'm about to go back to sleep, but when I do, I'll
dream of you. The time I spent with you was incredibly
fun. That's why I'll keep on dreaming of it forever."
"――――――"
<Page61>
"It may be meaningless, but it will definitely,
 be fun. That's why I'm happy, Shiki.
You've made me happy, just as you said you would."
"......!"
I'm all choked up.
For her to... I―――
<Page62>
"...You really are kind, aren't you, Shiki.
Yeah. I'm glad that I ended up coming here to say my
final goodbye."
<Page63>
"I love everything about you dearly.
I love your honesty, your recklessness, how you're only
fussy toward me, and how you face everything with all
your strength.# So, please―――keep on living just the
way you are."
For a brief moment―――
Her smile is tinged with sorrow.
<Page64>
Waving goodbye, she vanishes from my sight, as if
melting into the sunset.
<Page65>
"............"
I grit my teeth hard as I fight to control myself.
She was smiling right up until the end, so the least I
can do is hold back my tears.
<Page66>
―――I'm alone in the classroom.
"...I see. You kept your promise after all, didn't
you?"
In this classroom.
She made sure to keep the promise we'd made to meet
here again, in this classroom soaked in the light of
the setting sun.
<Page67>
...I may have lost something, but with this, everything
is over.
The time we spent together passed all too quickly, but
it's time to lower the curtain.
<Page68>
If you think about it, every meeting must eventually
end with a parting.
Ours just happened to come a little sooner than most.
It was a satisfying farewell.
After all, she was alive,# she was smiling,# and she told
me that... she was... happy...#"That's a lie...! That's not true,# that's―――#That's not what I wanted at all...!#"
<Page69>
―――That's right.
I wanted―――
I wanted to spend even more time with her.
I wanted to talk with her even more.
I wanted to feel more of her warmth.
I wanted――――to see more of that smile.
<Page70>
I...
I just wanted to make her happier than she'd ever been
before.
And yet―――
She kept on smiling, right up until the end, and her
final words were for me to keep on living.
<Page71>
"...You... idiot..."
That was her final wish.
...In truth, deep down, I'm as hollow as a corpse.
I know all too well that I'm a coward who simply
bottles up all the fear he feels.
<Page72>
With a smile, she told me that no matter how difficult
this precarious life may be―――right now I just have
to convince myself that everything's fine and keep on
moving forward, until the day comes when I can look
back and reminisce about the past.
<Page73>
There's no way I can do something like that.
I don't have even a shred of the confidence it requires
to live life that way.
Even so... if it's what it takes to make sure that the
dreams she sees are pleasant ones―――
Then I have no choice but to fulfill that wish of hers.
<Page74>
"......Ah."
When I come to my senses, I see that the sun has long
since set.
The crimson atmosphere has vanished, and the sky is
dyed a brilliant shade of blue.
<Page75>
A blue night sky.
A white shining moon.
―――That is all that remains.
That, and a beautiful memory.
<Page76>
"―――――――"
I sigh.
I take a long, deep breath, as though praying.
She may no longer be here.
But I need to get the words I'd forgotten to say off my
chest.
<Page77>
"Goodbye. I... had a lot of fun too."
This will be my final memory of her.
<Page78>
Eventually the moon will dim, and the night will come
to an end.
The moon hangs alone in the night sky, looking like a
piece of glass.
A memory of a distant moon, so fragile it could shatter
at the lightest touch.
For as long as I can―――
I continue to gaze up at the moon, until the night
gives way to the dawn.
