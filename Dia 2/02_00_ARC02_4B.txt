"I-I'm home..."
I open and close the front door as quietly as I can and
discreetly enter the lobby, announcing my return in a
voice that is neither too loud nor too quiet.
<Page2>
The time was eight o'clock, one minute ago.
I ran as fast as I could from the front of the station
and just barely made it in time, but honestly, it was
so hard that I feel like throwing up. That slope is too
much for my heart.
It was fine on the way to school because it was
downhill, but I forgot that it would be uphill on the
way back.
<Page3>
"Welcome home, Shiki-sama.
I know you are tired, but before you return to your
room, please come to the office.
―――Akiha-sama would like to have a word with you."
<Page4>
"... the office, is it?"
If Akiha's taking the trouble to call me into her
office, she must really be in a foul mood.
<Page5>
"You took a detour because you had money to spare.
As punishment, I will be reducing your monthly
allowance by about 20%."
<Page6>
And there you have it.
My sentence was handed down the instant I entered her
office. I didn't even have a chance to plead my case.
I hadn't thought about that... I guess I'll be
receiving my monthly allowance from Akiha from now on.
And to think it's already been reduced...
Rejoice, Father. Akiha grew up to be a much stricter
master than you.
<Page7>
"B-But that's not true, is it? I came back before
curfew, remember?
...Well, I didn't make it back before sunset, but..."
<Page8>
"Oh, I'm shocked. So you  aware that you made a
promise to me. In that case, why did you not keep it?"
"Ah. Well, I suppose that I forgot."
<Page9>
"Nii-san, I forgot to tell you something as well.
As an added punishment, you will not have dinner
tonight."
"Wha―――"
<Page10>
What a tyrant...!
If she's being this harsh even though I managed to make
it back on time, I shudder to think what would have
happened to Tohno Shiki if he'd broken the curfew...
<Page11>
...I trudge across the lobby, heading for my room.
I'd protested to the head of the family, but could not
undo the punishment of taking away my dinner.
On the other hand, my allowance was only cut by 10%.
It was a major victory in terms of a brother's dignity.
<Page12>
"Shiki-san, Shiki-san."
"...Kohaku-san?"
As I'm on my way back to my room, Kohaku-san calls out
to me.
She's hiding in one of the nooks in the corridor,
addressing me conspiratorially in much the same way as
she did this morning.
<Page13>
"Come on. That's no good, you should have come home on
time today at least.
After all, she came back incredibly early, believing
that you'd listen to what you were told, if only for
the first day."
"Wait, who came back?"
<Page14>
"Well obviously that's...# n-no, you know what, never
mind.
. In any case, as a servant, I cannot overlook the
fact that you did not have dinner.
As such, I have prepared a light meal for you in your
room.
Although it's just a rice ball and some miso soup."
<Page15>
"...!"
What a thoughtful maid she is...!
And this is on top of her returning my phone this
morning. To think that she'd go this far for me, even
though she's the one who'd be on the hook for it if
Akiha found out...
<Page16>
"Is this really okay? It'd be a huge help, but..."
"Of course. This is about your health, after all.
Besides, Hisui-chan has also agreed to this. Even if
Akiha-sama finds out, I'm sure she'll forgive us if we
both apologize."
"I see, that girl also..."
<Page17>
Despite appearances, she looked out for me.
It's hard to get a read on her because she doesn't
really let her emotions show, but it seems that Hisui
also felt bad about my 'no dinner' treatment.
<Page18>
"Shiki-san. Her name's not 'that girl'. It's
Hisui-chan."
"Ah, yeah, I know. But since I don't know her all that
well yet, I'd feel bad if I used her name so casually."
<Page19>
"No, you shouldn't do that. That's too cruel.
She may not look it, but Hisui-chan is very kind.
So please, think nothing of it and call her by her
first name as if she were family."
<Page20>
Kohaku-san is staring straight at me.
...She's right. It'd be difficult for Hisui if I
continued to act like a stranger.
I'm sure she's just as concerned about me as Kohaku-san
right now, so I should try to relax around her a bit
more.
<Page21>
"I understand. From now on, no matter what happens,
I'll call her Hisui-cha... no, saying 'chan' is a bit
too embarrassing, so I'll just call her Hisui."
"Please do. It would be much appreciated."
<Page22>
After that, Kohaku-san goes downstairs.
I say a silent prayer to my savior, the Nightingale of
the Tohno residence, and return to my room.
Rice balls, huh... Kohaku-san made them, so they must
be pretty tasty...
<Page23>
"―――, that was a nice bath."
I'd wolfed down the rice balls specially made by
Kohaku-san.
After that, Hisui came by to tell me that the bath was
ready.
By the time I come back from my bath, it's nine o'clock
in the evening.
<Page24>
It's a bit too early to go to bed.
I have nothing at hand to read other than a textbook.
I'm not even that tired today.
Rather than wasting time, I decide to―――
C:> Visit Akiha in the living room.
C:> Go to Kohaku-san's room.
C:> Rest here.
