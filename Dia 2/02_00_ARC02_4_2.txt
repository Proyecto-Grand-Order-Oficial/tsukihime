<Page1>
I'll drop by Kohaku-san's room.
I think I spotted where it was earlier when I was on my
way to the bathroom.
<Page2>
I make my way toward the end of the corridor on the
first floor of the west wing.
To give a sense of the location: the lobby is to my
rear and I'm pretty sure that the kitchen is at the end
of this corridor.
I think that Kohaku-san has made herself at home in the
small room right beside the kitchen.
<Page3>
"Kohaku-san's room is... this one?"
I knock on the door.
"Kohaku-san, are you there?"
<Page4>
"Yes, just a moment, please."
I hear a cheerful voice from inside the room.
After about two minutes, she comes out.
<Page5>
"Oh, if it isn't Shiki-san.
What are you doing at this hour?"
"Um, well. ...Actually, I was wondering if you'd let me
use your TV."
"Pardon?"
<Page6>
"Ah, you know, this mansion doesn't have a TV, right?
After living in a normal house all this time, I've
gotten in the habit of mindlessly watching TV for a
while before bed, and I'm having a little trouble
winding down without it..."
<Page7>
...The more I explain it, the more I realize how stupid
it all sounds.
It's incredibly strange behavior to barge into a girl's
room and demand to see her TV.
<Page8>
Even Kohaku-san is looking at me in disgust――――or
maybe not?
<Page9>
"It sounds very reasonable when you put it that way.
You've been living at the Arima household up until now
after all. The heavy atmosphere in this mansion must
have come as quite a shock."
<Page10>
"Um, let's see... have you told Akiha-sama or
Hisui-chan about this?"
"By 'this', you mean about me coming to your room?"
Kohaku-san nods.
<Page11>
"No, I haven't told anyone."
<Page12>
"Excellent. If you had, I would've needed to send you
away."
She replies with a smile, and then furtively glances
around the hallway.
<Page13>
"Fortunately, I don't see anybody around.
Now, it wouldn't do to be spotted out here so please
come on in."
She grabs hold of my arm.
"Wait, w-w-whoa...!?"
<Page14>
The inside of the room is quite different from what I
had expected.
Half of the room is occupied by tatami mats, with a
bunch of tansu chests closely packed in the back. That
half of the room is entirely Japanese in style.
On the other hand, the other half of the room, while
still simple, is westernized, reminiscent of a school
infirmary rather than a room in a Western-style
building.
<Page15>
"Sit wherever you like.
I'll go make some tea."
Kohaku-san leaves the room.
<Page16>
"......"
. After clearing my throat, I take a seat, opting
for the sofa on the wooden part of the floor over the
tatami.
<Page17>
Kohaku-san's room looks more like a well-organized
office than a girl's room.
All of the drawers in the chest at the back are very
small.
Each one can probably only hold a small handful.
<Page18>
"That chest, could it be...?"
Isn't this a chest for storing medicine?
...I'm pretty sure that's what it is. Back when I lived
with the Arimas, there was a chest just like this in
the room of the old town doctor that took care of me.
<Page19>
If that's the case... then is Kohaku-san also a
certified doctor...?
No, she can't be. She's too young to qualify.
<Page20>
Glancing around, I spot a TV remote on the cushion.
I wonder if Kohaku-san had actually been watching TV
when I knocked.
<Page21>
"Okay, thank you for your patience, Shiki-san.
Here's some tea for you."
"Ah, thanks for going out of your way."
<Page22>
"No no, I'm sorry that this is all I can whip up right
now."
With a friendly smile on her face, Kohaku-san serves me
a cup of strong green tea and some sweet bean jelly as
a snack.
<Page23>
"You came to watch TV, right?
What do you usually watch at this time?"
"Nothing specific... I guess the news?"
<Page24>
"Is that so?
You have such a relaxed personality that I assumed
you'd be the type to read after dinner."
<Page25>
"Unfortunately, I don't have such praiseworthy
inclinations.
I'm often mistaken for a diligent student, but I'm lazy
at heart.
I guess it's the glasses that make me look so earnest."
<Page26>
"―――Ah, that's right!
, so about those glasses that you wear, Shiki-san.
I was actually quite taken aback to see you in them
when I greeted you yesterday."
"Why's that?"
<Page27>
"Well, Akiha-sama never told me that you wear glasses.
I was prepared for a man with cool and sharp eyes, just
like her."
<Page28>
'My worries were unnecessary, though', adds Kohaku-san,
smiling.
...I see.
I guess I'd never actually met Akiha in person since I
started wearing these glasses.
<Page29>
"Well, these glasses are really just for show.
It's certainly true that there's something wrong with
my eyes, but my eyesight is actually above average.
It's not as though they went bad from studying too
hard. Ah... have I ruined your image of me as an
intellectual?"
<Page30>
"No, not at all.
I also enjoy watching TV more than reading books.
I'm glad that you're as lively as I thought you would
be."
<Page31>
"I-I see. Well, thanks."
Feeling embarrassed, I look away.
Getting struck by Kohaku-san's earnest smile at
point-blank range has made me quite flustered.
<Page32>
"Ah, I'm sorry.
You came to watch the news, and here I am chatting with
you."
Kohaku-san turns on the TV.
<Page33>
Images appear on the screen.
It's a little past 9:30 PM.
The news program is no longer a cheerful one for the
general audience; it has shifted tone, and is now
reporting on serious matters affecting society.
<Page34>
"Oh, dear. Another serial killing?"
The news is running a special report on a series of
murders.
The serial killings that started in the neighboring
district are now being replicated here near Souya
Station.
<Page35>
The story is simple.
'They indiscriminately abduct young women who are out
late at night, kill them, and drain their blood.'
Eight people have already fallen victim, and the
police's ability to keep up with the investigation has
been called into question.
<Page36>
No further details have been reported by the media.
When it comes to the common characteristics of the
victims, the precise cause of death, or any other
information, the news has obscured all details and
reported only that 'their blood had been drained'.
I guess this is a way of restricting information in
order to prevent copycat acts by amused criminals.
<Page37>
"It's a grim state of affairs. Just what are the police
even doing?"
"Hmmm... maybe they're having a hard time pinpointing a
motive because the crimes aren't premeditated? If a
spur-of-the-moment murder takes place in the middle of
the night, it'd be impossible to track the culprit
unless you caught them in the act. Motive... you can't
find a criminal unless you know their motive."
<Page38>
"The people that were attacked were just unlucky... or
perhaps you could say that the killer themselves has
very good luck, given that there were no eyewitnesses."
"Yes, well. Lucky or not, it's strange that the
murderer has gone unidentified for almost two weeks
now."
<Page39>
"I'm not so sure. If they were well-prepared, it
wouldn't be that unreasonable, would it?
All I can do is speculate, but I'd expect that the more
murders you commit, the more evidence you leave
behind."
<Page40>
"If it were eight missing people, I could understand
there not being enough information, but you'd think
that with all eight bodies having been found there'd be
enough circumstantial evidence to lead somewhere.
Therefore, there must be some reason why the culprit
still hasn't been caught."
<Page41>
"――――――"
...I can't say I expected that.
It's a bit of an unbecoming topic, but I'm impressed
all the same.
Whether or not Kohaku-san's speculation is correct, I
didn't expect her to think so deeply about the details
of the case.
<Page42>
"But that would make the killer a well-prepared
murderer, not a spur-of-the-moment thrill killer.
...If they were only pretending to be a thrill killer,
and were actually acting according to some secret plan,
then wouldn't that suggest that even though the victims
don't seem related in any way, there's really a common
thread tying them all together?"
<Page43>
"Well, I don't know about that.
If there were such a connection, the police would have
noticed it by the second victim or so.
After all, this is an incomprehensible case with a
superhuman level of preparation in terms of
concealment, but very little in terms of purpose."
<Page44>
...Kohaku-san talks about this disturbing topic with a
smile.
It seems as though she isn't particularly worried about
it.
<Page45>
"Kohaku-san, this is an incident that is happening in
this very city.
Don't you think it's a little scary, especially for a
young girl like you?"
<Page46>
"Oh no, it's okay.
After all, serial killers only appear in the middle of
the night. If I don't go out at night, I won't run into
any."
<Page47>
What a refreshing way of thinking.
It's a little too raw of a topic to fit a neat and tidy
explanation to, but maybe that's just the way it is
with incidents we learn about on the news.
<Page48>
"I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
I may swing by again sometime if I feel like watching
more, so thanks in advance."
<Page49>
"Yes, I'll be waiting for you."
Kohaku-san glances around the hallway.
<Page50>
"As much as I would like to see you back to your room,
Hisui-chan is waiting for you there, so this is where
we must part ways."
"Okay. Good night then."
<Page51>
"......"
...I didn't know that bedtime was ten o'clock here at
the mansion.
In addition to the eight o'clock curfew, there's an
unspoken rule that you aren't allowed to leave your
room after ten o'clock.
<Page52>
"Geez. It's so strict around here even without the old
man around."
...Well, I suppose it's not that surprising.
No matter how much technology advances or trends
change, the Tohno family has maintained this way of
life for hundreds of years.
Nothing will change just because Akiha became the head
of the family.
<Page53>
"......She's been rather good to me, hasn't she?
She sent away all the relatives, at least."
<Page54>
...I'm a little worn out from the atmosphere of this
unfamiliar mansion.
I think I'll obediently head back to my room for
tonight.
