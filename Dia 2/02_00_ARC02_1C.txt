The clock in the living room reads 7:30.
I can just about make it to school in half an hour, but
will Akiha be able to get there on time?
I think Asagami Private Girl's Academy is quite a ways
from here... hmm?
<Page2>
"...Shiki-san, Shiki-san... can you hear me? ...Yes,
you... I'm talking to you, who's on your knees in
despair, overwhelmed by Akiha-sama's merciless
treatment..."
"......"
<Page3>
I wonder what she's doing.
She's hiding behind the sofa, beckoning for me to come
closer.
<Page4>
"...I can hear you. What is it, Kohaku-san?"
"...Not exactly. ...I am a vague existence, a servant
and not a servant as well... so, I'm giving this back
to you..."
<Page5>
Kohaku-san furtively takes out a phone from the sleeve
of her kimono.
It's my phone that Akiha confiscated last night...!
<Page6>
"A-Are you sure?"
"Yes. But keep it a secret from Akiha-sama. Please be
careful not to get caught.
Also, please refrain from using it in the mansion.
Though, service is fairly spotty up here, so you might
not be able to even if you tried."
<Page7>
"Kohaku-san..."
Maybe there is some goodwill in this mansion after all.
I take the phone and quickly tuck it into the inner
pocket of my uniform.
<Page8>
"Please take this as well. This is the keycard for the
main gate.
If you press the buzzer I will unlock the gate for you,
but it takes me a little while to get to the security
office.
I know it's a hassle, but if you're in a hurry, you can
unlock the main gate with this."
<Page9>
A keycard for the main gate... as expected of the Tohno
residence, the security is excellent.
<Page10>
"Well then, I'll go see Akiha-sama off.
I'll leave the rest to you, Hisui-chan."
"Yes. Take care, Nee-san."
Kohaku-san leaves, following after Akiha.
<Page11>
"Will you have enough time, Shiki-sama?"
"Yeah, it's only half an hour's walk from here to the
school.
It's half-past seven now, so if I run a little on the
way I can make it. But thanks for asking, Hisui."
Satisfied with my explanation, Hisui nods.
<Page12>
"Now then, I will escort you out."
"Huh―――Ah, yeah, thanks."
<Page13>
...As I thought, I'm still embarrassed to have my own
servant.
Hisui urges me to get up from the sofa.
Despite the unexpected visitor, my first morning here
in seven years passed without incident.
<Page14>
Hisui sees me off as I leave the grounds of the
mansion.
The Tohno residence is located on the edge of the city,
atop a hill some distance from the station.
The hill is blanketed by a forest that is rather out of
place in an urban area. Depending on how you look at
it, the Tohno residence could be seen as a gate built
at the entrance to that forest.
<Page15>
From here to the school is a little over a
thirty-minute walk that crosses over the station.
If I hurry, I can make it in time for the morning
homeroom.
<Page16>
I walk down the long slope.
I always took the train from the Arima house to Souya
Station, so it's my first time going to school by this
route.
I feel like a new student, even though only my route
has changed.
<Page17>
"――――There aren't many students from my school."
It seems like only a few people from this neighborhood
attend Souya High School.
It's 7:30 in the morning.
As I jog down the street, I don't spot anyone else
wearing a school uniform.
<Page18>
Unlike the south gate of the station yesterday, the
north gate is crowded with commuters.
It's the usual scene of office workers in suits quickly
walking past.
<Page19>
The disturbing news of recent events seems to have had
no effect on them.
Or even if they are feeling unsettled, that isn't
enough of a reason to change their daily schedule.
<Page20>
Either way, there's no change in the city.
Arihiko said that he avoids going out at night, but I
guess not everyone can trust and follow their instincts
as he does.
<Page21>
I keep going past the station and into the residential
district.
The only people I see on the street now are students in
school uniforms.
I check my phone and see that I have five minutes left
before the school gates close.
Not wanting to be late, I run down the asphalt road,
keeping an eye out for cars.
<Page22>
Just as I told Hisui, it took me about thirty minutes
to reach the main gate from the mansion.
I ran a couple of times along the way, so if I want to
head to school at a leisurely pace, I should leave the
mansion before 7:30.
