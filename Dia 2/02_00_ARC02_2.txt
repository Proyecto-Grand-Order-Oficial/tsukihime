It's after school now#.
I didn't suffer from any anemic episodes today, and the
remainder of the afternoon passed peacefully, at least
as far as I was concerned.
However, a novel virus has spread like wildfire through
the classroom, and up until a moment ago, the
atmosphere in here was heavy with unrest.
<Page2>
The girls dubbed this new affliction the boys were
suffering from 'Noel Fever'.
It could also be called 'Noel Measles'.
The conflict between the boys who are delirious with
Noel Fever, and the girls, who look down coldly on the
whole affair, didn't even pause for lunch. Their battle
seems set to spill over into tomorrow.
<Page3>
On the other hand, the boys who didn't catch Noel Fever
were praised by the girls' group, but branded as
impotent, traitorous, and inappropriately fond of
little girls by the boys' group. It's a rather silly
story.
<Page4>
"...Well, she's certainly not the type of beauty you
see too often, that Noel-sensei."
<Page5>
Even so, I don't understand why everyone is so crazy
about her.
If we're talking beauty, Akiha is much more―――
<Page6>
"Ah, there you are. Got a minute, Shiki-kun?"
The person at the center of this turmoil arrives with
unbelievable timing!
<Page7>
"Oh my. You look like you nearly jumped out of your own
skin.
Were you thinking something indecent, by any chance?"
<Page8>
"N-No, nothing like that, not at all.
...Um. Leaving that aside, what can I do for you,
Noel-sensei?"
Swallowing the guilt of comparing Noel-sensei to Akiha,
I try my best to calmly change the subject.
<Page9>
However...
She smiles like she can see right through me.
<Page10>
".... 'Noel-' has a nice ring to it. It's
much better than being called senpai.
I was a little nervous about this since I'm not used to
Japan yet, but I think I could get used to being called
'Sensei' by naïve little boys like you.
―――It's kind of dirty, and a little bit exciting."
<Page11>
"Um, Noel-sensei...?
Y-You're a bit too close―――"
<Page12>
"Relax. This is the sort of situation where you should
just play dumb and go with the flow, you know.
Hey, look...... my neck, isn't it beautiful?"
<Page13>
Is it the tension, or the magic of the setting sun?
Her voice slips into my ear―――not from the front,
but from right behind me, as if she were whispering
directly to me.
<Page14>
"Don't be so cautious.
...Just intertwine your fingers with mine. Feel the
warmth of my body. Take me in your arms.
...Yes. I just want you to devour me..."
<Page15>
Her breathing comes closer. Our legs tangle together.
She wraps her arm around my back, as if to block my
escape.
Before me, I see―――
The strangely captivating, smooth neck of a woman―――
<Page16>
"...Look... the sound of my heartbeat alone is making
you melt, right...?
So just forget, forget about yourself, forget about...
everything that's in the way, take it all away... the
formalities, the glasses―――"
<Page17>
Her snake-like fingers touch the frame of my glasses.
The instant they do, my body recoils with fear simply
at the thought of 'seeing'.
<Page18>
"Just kidding! It was just a little joke to break the
ice ♡
In Japanese terms, you could call it a bit of ?
Or more like exchanging business cards? Mmm, either
way, it's just a bit of socializing between us, okay?"
<Page19>
"A joke? Noel-sensei..."
...I don't think that's the right word for what just
happened.
For a teacher, that kind of prank is way too far―――
<Page20>
"...What did you need me for, anyway?
You sounded like you were looking for me."
<Page21>
"Ah, never mind that. I just needed your help with
something, but it's already taken care of.
See you later, Shiki-kun. Be careful not to end up like
Toyama-sensei."
<Page22>
Noel-sensei waves her hand as she walks away.
I can't stop thinking about what she just said―――
C:> So I ask after Toyama-sensei.
C:> ...But I decide to give it up.
