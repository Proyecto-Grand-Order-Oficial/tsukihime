I'll stop by somewhere else on my way home.

It's not that I don't want to go back... It's just
going to take some time to get used to that luxurious
mansion.
Maybe I'll visit Arihiko's house, or swing by the
bookstore in the station.
Wherever I end up going, so long as I keep it under an
hour, I ought to be able to make it home before curfew.
