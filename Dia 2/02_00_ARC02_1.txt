<Page1>
At some point, you understood that this wasn't a dream.
<Page2>
The things that you see in this moment,
are actually the repetition of a past that really
occurred.
Perhaps it's a form of introspection and self-reproach.
A refrain of both present and future that borrowed the
form of a lucid dream.
<Page3>
You do not dream.
Even now, I'm not here.
Tohno Shiki does not know what it means to dream.
Even now, I don't know you.
<Page4>
And that's why this story must now come to an end.
Undeterred and unexisting, you are dreaming of a story
that has already passed.
<Page5>

Refrain, refrain, refrain, refrain...

"Good morning."
I hear an unfamiliar voice.
My deeply sunken consciousness awakens.
<Page7>
"It's morning. It's time to wake up, Shiki-sama."
...Like I said, please don't call me Shiki-sama.
I could have sworn I told you yesterday it makes me
uncomfortable―――
<Page8>
"――――――."
After opening my eyes, I grab my glasses from the
nightstand and put them on.
Immediately, the anomaly fades away.
I lift myself out of bed to try and shake off my
sluggishness.
<Page9>
"......"
Where am I?
<Page10>
"Good morning, Shiki-sama."
The girl in the maid uniform bows.
"...Ah, I see. I've returned to the Tohno mansion,
haven't I?"
<Page11>
"Yes. You must have been quite tired yesterday."
Hisui is standing stiffly at attention in front of the
door, eyeing me as I get my bearings. She looks like a
well-made statue.
<Page12>
"......"
Perhaps it's because I slept in an unfamiliar room, but
my mind is completely vacant. It's as though my
thoughts are obscured by fog.
"Shiki-sama...?"
Hisui calls out to me.
I shake my head vigorously to wake myself up.
<Page13>
"Morning, Hisui. Thanks for going out of your way to
wake me up."
"Such words are unnecessary.
It is my duty to wake you up, after all."
<Page14>
...Hisui replies nonchalantly.
I feel a faint sense of unease, or that I'm somehow
unworthy of this gesture.
If she were half as cheerful as Kohaku-san, she'd be a
force to be reckoned with, wouldn't she?
Well, not that it's my place to try and find fault with
her personality.
<Page15>
"Is there anything I can help you with?"
As if she noticed my gaze, Hisui looks straight back at
me.
<Page16>
"No, it's nothing.
It's just that when I saw your face, it really sunk in
that this is the Tohno residence."
<Page17>
I get up from the bed and then pause for a second.
It's just before seven in the morning.
It's a little earlier than I'd usually be up.
<Page18>
"I'll head downstairs after I get changed.
Should I go to the living room... or not, maybe the
dining room instead?"
<Page19>
"Yes, please come to the dining room. Breakfast is
ready."
"Alright. Thanks."
Hisui bows and leaves the room.
<Page20>
I head down to the first-floor lobby.
I said I'd get changed, but only my shirt and underwear
are fresh. The rest of my school uniform is the same as
I had on yesterday.
The dining room is right at the entrance to the west
wing... If you stand in the lobby, the dining room is
the large room to your left; directly opposite it
across the stairs is the living room in the east wing.
<Page21>
"Good morning, Shiki-san.
I will have breakfast ready for you right away."
<Page22>
Kohaku-san is waiting for me in the dining room.
The reason why she called me 'Shiki-san' was probably
because Hisui had told her to last night.
Hisui is adamant about using '-sama', but Kohaku-san
seems to be flexible about it.
It really highlights the difference in their
personalities.
<Page23>
Kohaku-san serves the food quickly and efficiently.
It's a pure, captivating Japanese-style breakfast,
following the 'one soup, three dishes' rule.
However―――
<Page24>
"...Oh no. I should have told you yesterday."
"Oh, is there something in there you don't like?
Shiki-san, do you not like turnips?"
"No, I'm proud to say that I'm not a picky eater, but
how should I say this..."
<Page25>
It's a bit too much.
I'm already a light eater at the best of times, but in
the mornings I can barely stomach anything.
When I eat neatly arranged food, I start to get
heartburn and lose my appetite.
I'm feeling good this morning, so I think I can
probably eat half a bowl, but when I'm not feeling well
I sometimes put my chopsticks down after a single bite.
<Page26>
"Is that so? ...I've heard that you're a light eater,
so I tried to go easy on you with this one, but... is
it too much?"
"I'm sorry. It's just the after-effects of an accident,
and there's not much I can do about it... Ah, b-but I
can tell it looks really good! This breakfast is
absolutely perfect!"
<Page27>
I do my best to express my honest opinion.
It's not her fault at all, I can't let my selfishness
ruin the meal she prepared.
<Page28>
"Anyway, thanks for the food.
I'm sorry if I leave anything on the plate."
<Page29>
"No, don't worry about it. I'm a pro in this field too.
I'll make sure you get the right amount.
Anyway, please eat. If it isn't to your liking, don't
hesitate to let me know."
<Page30>
"Thank you for the food. It was incredibly delicious."
I put my hands together and thank her.
<Page31>
Kohaku-san's breakfast was perfect in both appearance
and taste.
It was elegant and lightly seasoned fare, but still had
enough of a kick to it to stimulate my appetite.
An average high school boy would've gone for a second
helping without hesitation.
<Page32>
"I'm sorry that I left some of the food you prepared
for me, though."
<Page33>
"It's okay, it's my fault for not asking about it
first.
Besides, I'm already quite pleased. You seemed to be
thoroughly enjoying it as you ate. It's worth all the
hard work I've put in for this day."
<Page34>
Kohaku-san smiles at me.
...I think she's got it backwards.
I'm the one who should be pleased, especially after
seeing a face like that.
<Page35>
"...Oh no, it's already this late.
Don't mind me and please go to the living room. I'll
prepare some after-breakfast tea for you there. If I
monopolize you too much, I'm afraid of what might
happen later."
<Page36>
Chuckling, Kohaku-san clears the table.
It's 7:20. I should be getting ready for school.
I thank her once again for the meal and leave the
dining room.
