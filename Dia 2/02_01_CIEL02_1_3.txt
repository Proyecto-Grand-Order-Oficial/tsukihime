<Page1>
As soon as I step into the hallway, I run into a
familiar upperclassman.
<Page2>
"What's the matter, Senpai?
Do you have some business with the second-year
classrooms?"
<Page3>
"Yes, I most certainly do. Not with the second-year
classrooms themselves per se, but with a certain
second-year student."
Ciel-senpai trots up to me, a broad smile on her face.
<Page4>
"I was just picking up some of the exceptional new
products they have at the school store, but ended up
getting carried away and overbuying.
I can't eat it all by myself, so I've come to snag
someone that seems free to help share the load."
<Page5>
"Ah. You've come to snag someone, have you?"
<Page6>
I don't see many students around with time on their
hands, but anyone would make time if Senpai invited
them out somewhere. Heck, there'd be a queue.
Anyway, putting that aside―――
<Page7>
"Senpai, you're an upperclassman, you can't just come
waltzing into the second-year classrooms. If you're
going to invite someone to join you, why not one of
your third-year classmates? I'm sure they'd make for a
livelier conversation partner."
<Page8>
"That may be true, but I'm in the mood to talk to a
younger boy today. I just feel like it, so please don't
ask me to explain my reasons."
As she speaks, Senpai quickly closes the distance
between us.
<Page9>
"On that note, Tohno-kun, are you free?"
"Huh... well... I guess so.
I was on my way to get lunch, though."
<Page10>
"Well consider yourself snagged. Let's go get to know
each other over lunch.
I'll help myself to a serving of your time to go along
with the fabulous meal I've brought."
<Page11>
"――――――"
With a smile on her face, she tugs softly on my sleeve.
It's such an insignificant gesture, but it carries a
mysterious coercion that I feel utterly powerless to
resist.
<Page12>
We go out to the courtyard.
Autumn is beginning to strengthen its hold over the
weather, and even though the sun is out it's a little
chilly.
The only students eating lunch in the courtyard in
spite of that are those that appreciate the elegance of
the place, and Senpai seems to be among them.
<Page13>
"Oh, the benches are unusually empty today.
You're lucky indeed, Tohno-kun!"
<Page14>
Senpai skips over to one of the benches and sits down.
I follow her example, taking a seat next to her at a
respectful distance.
<Page15>
"So, what's this new product in the school store?
Did they bring back the crab cream croquette rolls that
vanished a year ago?"
...They really did have a delicacy like that on the
menu, back in the day.
They were so expensive that they were discontinued
after the first week, but a lot of students are still
holding out hope they'll make a comeback.
<Page16>
", well you see..."
Senpai is positively beaming as she places the paper
bag on her lap. Reaching inside, she pulls out four
pieces of stuffed bread.
<Page17>
"Ta-da! It's been a week since I advised the school
store on their supply chain! At last! They can sell
authentic bakery products!"
<Page18>
The objects threatening to spill from her hand are
stout, oval-shaped loaves of bread.
The outside has been fried to a crisp dark brown, and
still glistens with oil.
All four of them appear to be the exact same size and
shape.
They are, beyond a shadow of a doubt, freshly fried
curry bread.
<Page19>
"Ah... They're so perfectly fried you'd think they were
freshly baked... Though, at 300 yen a piece, they're
pretty expensive. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say
this is the pinnacle of student luxury.
Here you go. I'll divide it in half just for you, so
please dig in―――Tohno-kun?"
<Page20>
"...Um, look. Senpai, this is―――"
This is the curry bread sold at the famous bakery in
front of the station, isn't it?
<Page21>
"Why?"
What does she mean 'why'.
I don't know what to say to that 'Are you sure you're
from Earth if this doesn't make you happy?' look she's
giving me.
<Page22>
"You had the same thing yesterday... Senpai, are you
into spicy food?"
For some reason, I specifically avoid asking 'do you
like curry?'
<Page23>
"Y-Yeah, well. Ah, but it's not that I like it because
it's spicy, it's just that I find certain flavors very
delicious... b-but, you're right. No matter how much I
like it, all four have the same flavor. I didn't really
think this through..."
<Page24>
Good... At least she seems to understand that it's
slightly strange behavior.
<Page25>
"Still, I get it. It's easy to feel nervous if you
don't stock up on the things you enjoy.
Well then, let me take you up on that offer and help
myself to one."
<Page26>
I pick up one of the curry bread spread out on Senpai's
lap and bring it to my mouth.
<Page27>
"Thanks for the meal... Mmmmmm. The outside is crunchy,
the bread is slightly sweet with a hint of oil, and the
inside is packed with filling... Yep, it's delicious.
It's really delicious, Senpai."
<Page28>
I don't eat this kind of food very often, so it's a
welcome change.
I used to avoid fried bread because of its high oil
content, but it's very tasty if enjoyed in moderation.
<Page29>
"But, Senpai, are you going to be okay? Curry and fried
bread sit pretty heavy in the stomach. I would have
thought that'd be a little rough for a girl."
"I-Is that so?
Let's see... I have PE afterward, so I think I can
digest it without any problem, yup."
<Page30>
"......"
If you're going to be running around later, wouldn't
you want to eat something a little easier to digest?
I'm not entirely sure what she's basing her logic on
here.
<Page31>
"The only thing I have going for me is that I'm strong.
Ah, more importantly, we need tea, right? Is barley tea
okay, Tohno-kun?"
<Page32>
"Aye, gotta be barley tea for the Japanese, don't it?
Whoa, snagged a leftover curry bread!"
"~"
<Page33>
It's no wonder that Senpai is surprised.
I don't know when he managed to sneak up behind us, but
he suddenly snakes an arm out from behind the bench,
brazenly snatches up a piece of curry bread and downs
it in one bite.
<Page34>
"Oh man, this is good. It's really good. The curry
comes through nice and strong. It's almost too much of
a treat for someone who just woke up hungry!
Hmm, maybe it's a little hard on the stomach, but
knowing it's filled with Senpai's devotion evens it
right out!"
<Page35>
Arihiko guffaws heartily.
This guy saw me and Ciel-senpai together and snuck up
on us...!
<Page36>
"Arihiko... why are you so good at getting in people's
way? Is this a curse for something I did in a previous
life? Or is this just the way you are?"
<Page37>
"  , you won't get the jump on me, dear sir. I
just can't let you enjoy something so delicious-looking
alone.
I mean c'mon, you're having lunch, so why don't you let
me join you? I gave up my seat yesterday, so now it's
your turn to give up yours, don't you think?"
<Page38>
Arihiko seems to have convinced himself that he was
actually saving a seat for Senpai at lunch yesterday.
He has quite the convenient memory.
<Page39>
".... Sorry, Senpai. This idiot from my class is
being rude. I know I'm asking a lot, but he did come in
handy yesterday, so could you please let him si―
Senpai?"
My gaze shifts from Arihiko to Senpai.
And then.
<Page40>
"Unfortunately, your request is rejected.
Inui-kun, please stand still and accept what's coming
to you."
<Page41>
Senpai has leapt nimbly to her feet and adopted a
fighter's stance.
<Page42>
Her left jab cuts through the air with a whoosh.
"Why do you look like a professional!?"
Even to us amateurs, it's clear that this is flawless
shadowboxing.
<Page43>
"S-She's angry, Arihiko. She's mad as hell over a mere
bite of curry bread."
<Page44>
"O-Oh, what the hell is this? I can't stop sweating.
This is bad, real bad. The shock waves from her fists
are making her look bigger.# Ah,# She just grazed me, she
grazed the tip of my nose, help me Tohno, hurry up and
apologize to her or something!"
"You're the one who should apologize! Get away from me,
get away from me, are you trying to drag me down with
you?!"
I pry myself away from the clinging Stupihiko.
<Page45>
"Whoa that's cold, some friend you are, Tohno! I'm
sorry, Senpai, but grabbing your food was a
spur-of-the-moment type deal, or a flirting thing, or
an attempt to have lunch with you, you know!?"
<Page46>
"I see. So that's what you wanted.
But I don't see your admission ticket anywhere. Given
that it's lunch, shouldn't you bring something to eat?"
"Okay, got it! I'll go get something right away!"
<Page47>
Arihiko sprints away at top speed.
Ciel-senpai sits back down on the bench as if nothing
had happened.
<Page48>
"I have to say I'm troubled by Inui-kun.
Not only did he not say 'thanks for the food', but he
also swallowed it in one bite, completely failing to
show appreciation for the food.
However, I'll give him a pass this time, since he's put
on two good shows for me."
She shrugs her shoulders hopelessly and grumbles a
complaint very befitting of an upperclassman.
<Page49>
"Sorry for the wait! I got the tickets!"
"Oh."
"."
Arihiko returns after about five minutes.
In his hands, he's carrying two bulging paper bags.
<Page50>
"Hey, that's too much..."
"What do you think? I bought up as much as I could.
―――I was hoping this much food would calm her down."
<Page51>
I see... she must have really scared him back then.
That must have been a fear that only the person who was
being targeted could feel.
<Page52>
"Even so, two full bags of curry bread is overdoing it
a little. This isn't just a plateful of croquettes
here, how are you going finish all these?"
<Page53>
"If we can't finish them all, we'll just hang onto
them. They'll keep for a while, so we can snack on them
until lunchtime tomorrow.
So without further ado, here, Senpai.
Please take this as an apology for earlier, and a bribe
in exchange for eating lunch with you."
<Page54>
"Well, well, thank you very much for your kindness.
Please sit on the bench, Inui-kun. I'll just stand
here."
"Whatcha talking about?# Please sit down, Senpai.
So, what did you guys talk about while I was gone?
Making plans to go play about after school?"
<Page55>
"On the contrary, we were talking about stuff inside
the school.
Since you weren't here this morning, you don't even
know that a new teacher has replaced Toyama-sensei.#
What a shame. She's so beautiful that the guys in our
class are in a frenzy over her."
<Page56>
"That's news to me. A new teacher, like a transfer
student kinda deal?
...So, what's she like? I'm not really into high-handed
female teachers."
"Yeah, I get the feeling that she was still a trainee
up until last year, and she seems like the comforting
type.# You like older women who are patient, don't you?
Lucky for you. She's twenty-five, exactly how you like
it."
<Page57>
"Hold on, not twenty-five, anything but twenty-five!
She's the same age as my sister. That's the only thing
I can't physically accept!"
<Page58>
"Oh. Inui-kun, do you prefer older women?"
"Yes, I do. Older women aren't troublesome.# Ah, well,
if she's cute I can go a year younger."
<Page59>
"Hmm hmm... so you're good at both pampering and
bullying?
By the way, what about you, Tohno-kun? Do you like
older women?"
<Page60>
"I-I've never really thought about it, but I don't
think I'm quite as unrestrained as Arihiko."
"Hey, wait a minute. That's bullshit. I don't know why,
but you seem like you'd kill with older women. Aren't
there, like, tons of stories about tutors and doctor's
daughters, and that sort of thing?"
<Page61>
"Shut up. Just shut up. I've never hired a tutor in the
first place."
<Page62>
".# So, do you know the daughter of some doctor?"
"Y-Yes, but only as acquaintances!
Ciel-senpai, please don't fall for Arihiko's nonsense!"
<Page63>
"It's not nonsense thooough. It's true, thooough. In
fact, you ran off and had lunch with an older student,
didn't yooou?"
<Page64>
"That's right. Tohno-kun was wandering around so weakly
and unguardedly I couldn't help but bring him with me.
It was like running into a rabbit in a snowfield."
"Well, he's actually a cold-blooded creature in a
rabbit's skin. A spider, or scorpion, that kinda
machine-like creature."
<Page65>
Senpai and Arihiko laugh together.
I want to object, but I'm afraid I'll end up bringing
unnecessary trouble upon myself, so I stay silent.
And so, the number of curry buns steadily dwindles.
I would like to correct my earlier comment about
croquettes on a plate. The mountain of fried bread is
now being consumed as easily as a light snack.
There are less than twenty minutes left before the end
of lunch.
What will be the fate of these pieces of curry bread?
<Page66>
Our conversation continues right up until the end of
the lunch break.
Arihiko and I would talk about stupid things,
Ciel-senpai would give her opinion, and the
conversation would start all over again. We are also
running out of curry bread.
Such a purposeless and extremely ordinary moment passes
like flowing sand.
<Page67>
"Whoops, looks like it's about time I start to get a
headache. Man, I'm stuffed... wait, hold up.# I don't
think I ate anything. I don't think I could've eaten
anything...# Whatever, I'm getting sleepy so I'm gonna
run to the infirmary.
See you later, Senpai, and next time just the two of us
please!"
<Page68>
Arihiko runs off to the infirmary, seemingly fully
intent on skipping afternoon classes as well.
<Page69>
"Oh dear. I know I should be careful, but strangely
enough, I've become lenient toward Inui-kun. Is this
benevolence?"
Ciel stares at Arihiko in exasperation until he
disappears from the courtyard.
<Page70>
"That guy's an expert at doing only as much as he has
to. He's the kind of guy who cleans up his own mess. I
think you should just trust in him and let him be."
<Page71>
"I see. I have a feeling that's true.
I guess you would understand him well after knowing him
so long, huh?"
<Page72>
"I just can't seem to get rid of him, is all. I'm sure
you'll understand soon enough.
He's an idiot through and through."
Although I'm badmouthing him, Senpai keeps on smiling
gently.
<Page73>
"...Erm. What's with the smile?"
"No, no. You're smiling, so I'm smiling along with you.
We had a good time today, didn't we?"
<Page74>
"――――――"
I only notice my smile after she says that.
She's right, this was a moment I should treasure.
Come to think of it, I've never spent time hanging
around in the courtyard acting like a normal student
before.
<Page75>
"...Yes, it was. It was kind of fun.
I've never been out in the courtyard much. But I think
I've seen something like this before. Was it when I met
you?"
<Page76>
I think back to when I first met Senpai.
She was―――
"Yes, there have been many moments like this.
Too many to count, I'm sure."
She replies with a sincere smile.
