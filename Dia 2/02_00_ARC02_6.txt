"...Ah, enough, just shut up already!"
I open my eyes and put on my glasses.
I can still hear the dog howling outside my window.
<Page8>
The clock has just struck eleven.
It's more than just disturbing my sleep.
<Page9>
"Damn... What the hell is with that noise...?"
I can hear the dog's howl coming from all the way
outside the mansion.
...If this keeps up, I'm not gonna get any sleep.
<Page10>
"...I guess I gotta go check it out.
Even if I called the police and told them some dog was
being too noisy, I doubt they'd come."
<Page11>
I get out of bed and change back into my school
uniform.
I'm sure that Akiha and the others are having trouble
sleeping as well.
I'm the only man in the mansion, so I guess it falls to
me to go find out what's going on here.
<Page12>
I leave the mansion.
Nothing moves, as though the night has frozen over.
<Page13>
The moon is hidden behind the clouds.
Even the light from the streetlamps appears to have
congealed, like paint drops on a canvas.

<Page15>
Oddly enough, the howling sounds quieter now that I'm
out here.
Maybe it's just starting to die down?
Either way, it doesn't matter much.
The noise is more painful to my mind and eyes than to
my ears.
Just listening to it makes my heart pound so fast that
I start to feel sick.
<Page16>
"Shut up."
My legs feel heavy as I start walking.
I start to lose feeling in my fingertips.
Suddenly.
I notice that my breath is white.
<Page17>
The area around the mansion has fallen even quieter.
It feels as if everything has ceased to exist.
In this frozen world, my shadow is the only thing that
moves.
<Page18>
"........."
I don't know why I'm so thirsty.
The meandering road next to the tall walls around the
mansion stretches on endlessly into the night.
Warming my numb fingers with my breath, I walk in the
direction of where the dogs are probably gathered.
<Page19>
"――――――Huh?"
My thoughts come to a halt.
In the distance, under a streetlight, I see something.
It's like nothing I've ever seen before. Something that
by all rights I   see.
An impossible sight―――
<Page20>
                                    A melting dog.
What is that?!
                       A long blade pointed at it.
What is that?!
                                    A melted howl.
What is that?!
                        A long blade that pierces.
What is that?!
<Page21>
It screams as if it had gone mad.
A gale force scream.
After the sound that tore at my eardrums had passed,
there were no more howls. Not even a single trace of
the dog remains.
As if it had never existed in the first place.
It faded away without a trace.
<Page22>
―――So, it's an illusion.
Is what I'm seeing now a hallucination or a dream?
<Page23>
―――Then, is that an illusion too?
There, under the streetlight that slices through the
darkness, stands a figure I can't comprehend.
<Page24>
Is that... a coat?
The figure wearing a thick coat doesn't seem to notice
me as I stand stock still.
<Page25>
"――――――"
I'm thirsty. My whole body is sweating.
The night air sticks to my skin.
It's not like anything is wrong with me.
But everything feels heavy, like I'm at the bottom of
the ocean.
<Page26>
[zap00][zap00][zap00][zap00][zap00][zap00][zap00][zap00]
I hear the sounds of a distant, foreign country.
I'm struck by a dizziness that almost knocks me
unconscious.
I put all my strength into my staggering legs and
manage to stay on my feet.
And then―――
All I see before me is the usual, quiet road.
<Page27>
"――――"
I breathe a sigh of relief, my lungs greedily taking in
the air.
...I didn't realize it, but I haven't been breathing
properly since I left the main gate.
<Page28>
"........."
I don't hear them howling anymore.
...I leave the illusory fever dream I just witnessed
behind me.
<Page29>
...I'm back in my room.
I didn't notice any signs that Akiha or the others are
awake.
It seems like I was the only one who couldn't stand
that dog's howling.
<Page30>
"―――――."
What  that?
My head still hurts.
<Page31>
"Huh? Why am I shaking?"
My fingers are trembling.
My whole body is shaking, and my back feels so cold.
Metaphorically speaking―――
it's like someone ripped out my spinal cord and put a
pillar of ice in its place.
<Page32>
"―――――"
I feel dizzy and lightheaded.
I wonder if it's the usual anemia.
I feel like my consciousness is being thrown to the
ground, brain and all.
As this is going on, I notice something unsettling.
<Page33>
"――――――"
Even though I'm wearing my glasses, I can still see
those 'lines'.
<Page34>
"......!"
My eyeballs can't take the nausea that's been building
up.
It's a reaction to the fact that I've been trying not
to see them for the last seven years.
<Page35>
My mind can't bear this scene.
I feel sick. Combined with the dizziness from the
anemia, I feel like I'm about to throw up at any
moment.
<Page36>
"No way. What the hell is going on?"
I really don't know.
But as long as I keep my eyes open, I can't help but
see the lines.
<Page37>
"―――This is a bad dream."
I manage to fall onto my bed.
...Yeah, in that case, I should just go to sleep. It's
the quickest way to deny what I've seen.
<Page38>
...I can't even move my body like I want to.
For now, I'm just going to stay like this, like a
corpse.
I just need to go to sleep, like a puppet with broken
strings―――
