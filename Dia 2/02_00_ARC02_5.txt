It's ten o'clock.
The lights turn themselves off automatically without me
having to do anything.
Seems like all of the lights, except for those in the
office, are programmed to switch off at this hour.
You can turn any of them on again just by flicking the
switch, but doing so seems to be reserved for emergency
situations.

If I use the table lamp provided, people will probably
notice that I'm staying up late.
On top of that, leaving your room after ten o'clock is
expressly forbidden.

"...Hmmm.
Maybe I could smuggle in a stand light?"
These days, there are foldable lamps the size of a
mobile phone.
I could stay up as long as I want after lights-out...

"Well, not that I even need to... Going to sleep at
night is the natural course of action.
If it's exam period, surely they'll give me more time
to study before bedtime."

I change into the provided nightwear and crawl into
bed.
...Ever since the accident, I've been reluctant to lie

I didn't want to put myself in a comfortable position,
especially in a soft bed.

Back when I was at the Arima house, it used to drive
Keiko-san up the wall.
She said that although I was a deep sleeper, I wasn't a
child who would fall asleep on my own.

"―――Okay, time to sleep."
I assure myself that I can obviously fall asleep.
I take off my glasses and close my eyes.
It was only when I was a child that I had trouble
sleeping.
Now, if I close my eyes just like this, I can fall
asleep just like everyone else―――
