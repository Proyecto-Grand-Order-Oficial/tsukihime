I'll just take it easy and buy some bread.
Money is going to be a lot tighter from now on.
Our family head is a harsh mistress, so I shouldn't
hold out any hope for extra allowance. It's
unfortunate, but there's little I can do about it.
<Page2>
As such, I want to keep my expenses as low as possible.
It'd be pathetic beyond belief to be broke in an
emergency.
<Page3>
I buy some affordably priced bread and tea from the
school store.
They've just started carrying some new bread products,
so the line was a little longer than usual. The people
that brought a packed lunch are already done eating,
and are sitting around chatting.
<Page4>
"Tohno-kun, are you about to have lunch?"
"Yeah. It's pretty quiet in here, so I figure I can
take my time. What about you, Yumizuka-san?"
<Page5>
"Ah, I already had mine.
But, uh, I have a couple of leftover side dishes...
Since you're about to eat, would you like some extra
sides with your lunch?"
<Page6>
"――――――"
I surreptitiously cast a glance over at the gaggle of
girls nearby.
It seems like at least a few of them are gossiping
about the fact that Yumizuka is talking to me.
...Whatever the reason, it's clear that she'll be
teased by the other girls if I refuse.
<Page7>
"That would be great, thanks. Only eating bread would
get a bit monotonous, so thanks for spicing things up."
I clasp my hands together and thank Yumizuka.
<Page8>
"Y-Yes, you're right, it would be a little depressing
to only have bread for lunch!
Here you go! Fried chicken and clams boiled in soy
sauce!"
<Page9>
It's a strange combination.
The fried chicken was made by her mother, but the
boiled clams were apparently made by Yumizuka. To her
credit, I'll say that the taste is average.
Still, I think her contribution made for a spectacular
lunch.
<Page10>
"Thanks for the food, it was delicious.
I'll be sure to return the favor if the opportunity
arises."
"N-No, it's okay, today was just a coincidence!
A-Anyway... Oh right! Did you hear the news about
Toyama-sensei?"
<Page11>
"About Toyama-sensei? Oh, you mean from yesterday?
I've heard rumors that something awful happened."
<Page12>
"Yeah! You know, I heard that was a misunderstanding!
I heard she was involved in a car accident and broke
her leg, so she had to be hospitalized."
<Page13>
"I see. That's good. Ah, wait, no it isn't.
If you're hospitalized because of a leg injury, it
means you can't walk, right? Toyama's going to be
pissed about that for sure."
<Page14>
"Ah...
Y-You're right, I don't know what I was so happy
about...
I'm sorry, I didn't think it through..."
<Page15>
Yumizuka's smile changes to a look of remorse.
Though, I understand how she feels.
It was only a rumor, but people were going around
saying that Toyama-sensei had died. It's pretty
reasonable to be relieved when you find out that she's
actually only hurt her leg.
<Page16>
"Don't worry about it, I feel the same way you do.
Then again, we won't have a homeroom teacher for a
while. It's going to be lonely without her."
"Yeah, I hope she's back on her feet again soon."
<Page17>
I get caught up in Yumizuka's smile, and my expression
softens slightly.
She isn't incredibly beautiful or anything, but she has
a charm that makes everyone around her feel at ease.
<Page18>
In fact, she's so good-natured that people have started
relying on her as a sort of class counselor.
<Page19>
She's a laid-back person, but she's popular.
She was nominated as a class committee member by
unspoken agreement of the class, and the fact that
she's been able to carry out the role despite her
humble protestations about not being up to it speaks to
her natural virtue... or rather, her good character.
<Page20>
"........."
I find myself with only two minutes left until the end
of lunch break.
I've just heard some good news, and without Arihiko
around to cause trouble, the rest of the afternoon
should pass peacefully.
"........."
There's just one thing...
Why isn't she going back to her desk?
<Page21>
"Yumizuka-san, it's almost time for fifth period."
"!? Ah, yeah, I know, one minute, one minute until
the bell rings!"
<Page22>
"Yeah. People won't start heading back to their seats
until after the bell rings, so there's still a bit of
time, but..."
"A-Ah, well, I might not have much time, but I'd better
take my chances while Inui-kun isn't here, so, um!"
"Hm?"
<Page23>
Everyone begins to take their seats before the bell
rings. In the meantime―――
<Page24>
"Well, you see!
Here, I have a spare, maybe you can use it!?"
<Page25>
Yumizuka holds out what looks like a card. This is a...
family restaurant's loyalty card...?
<Page26>
"T-Thanks, but are you sure?"
"I-I've got a lot of points!
You see, my friend was in a tight spot and got a
part-time job, and the manager gave her a bunch of
cards! Please feel free to stop by and eat with us!
Around seven o'clock or so!"
Yumizuka scampers back to her seat, almost falling over
herself.
<Page27>
The bell rings.
"........."
I'm overjoyed, but this actually makes things a little
complicated.
Arihiko had actually brought this up at lunch the other
day.
<Page28>
Our chat about the Tohno family had come to a grinding
halt, and we were just about done with our lunches.
"By the way, about Yumizuka...
You got any feelings for her? Thinking of going out
with her at all?"
He suddenly broaches my private life.
<Page29>
"......What made you bring that up?"
"Well, she approached you again this morning, didn't
she? I'm just a little worried is all. Yumizuka's
basically the class idol. If there's any chance that
you have a thing for her, I'd like to stop you."
"Huh? What the hell is that? It's none of your business
what I think of her."
<Page30>
"Of course not. I just don't want to see anyone end up
in a relationship where both people are unhappy.
Yumizuka is, how should I put it...
Well, whatever. It's definitely not my place to butt
in.
So, what's the deal? You feel like going out with her?
Since she's made this many moves, she'd probably say
yes right away, don't you think?"
<Page31>
"...I think that would be difficult."
", she isn't your type?"
"That's not what I meant. I'm warning you, Yumizuka-san
is my type. I'll do whatever it takes to stop you if
you try and make a pass at her."
<Page32>
"What're you, her dad? Why are you keeping your
distance then?"
"Well, that's because... how do I put this, looking at
her makes me sad for some reason."
"―――That's awful.
So all that talk about going out with her was off the
mark huh?"
<Page33>
...I can't stop thinking about my selfish thoughts.
But it's not as though I can help it.
<Page34>
Subconsciously, I tend to avoid people who have decent
values... people who I can respect.
It's not that I don't like them, it's more like I'm
afraid to get too close to them.
<Page35>
"......Mmm."
I have a card with exactly 1,000 yen worth of points
saved up on it.
The name of the restaurant is Lindberg. It's your
average family restaurant, located over by the north
gate of Souya Station.
