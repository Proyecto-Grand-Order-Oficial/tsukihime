I exit into the hallway and start heading for the
stairs.
The cafeteria and the school store are both located on
the first floor, so I need to head downstairs
regardless.
<Page2>
...However.
When I go to head down the stairs, I'm greeted by an
unexpected sight.
The new teacher, Noel-sensei, is standing in the
hallway doing nothing.
<Page3>
It's unusual to find teachers in the hallway during
lunchtime.
The teachers at our school usually have lunch in the
staff room, prep room, or the designated staff area in
the cafeteria.
There's no reason for one of them to be hanging around
by the second-floor landing.
Could it be...
<Page4>
"Sensei. Are you lost by any chance?"
I doubt she is, but I call out to her just to be sure.
<Page5>
"Aw c'mon, do I look that unreliable?
I'm just here for a change of pace, a little breather.
The staffroom here is just way too ."
<Page6>
"'We'll only be with you for a short time, but please
consider us family.'
You can't help but be taken aback when someone says
stuff like that to you, right?
They invited me to a welcome party to celebrate my
first day, but I just wasn't mentally prepared for it,
y'know?
When everyone's smiling at you it can actually be kinda
scary, don't you agree?"
"―――Huh. Well, I guess so."
<Page7>
 the one who's taken aback here.
I ended up replying casually to Noel-sensei's frank
remarks, as though the two of us were friends.
<Page8>
"Right? I thought that high school teachers would be
exhausted from dealing with all the kids who act like
adults.
A teacher must be tough, positive, and smiling.
I'm pretty confident in my smile, but I'm still feeling
a little put out after seeing the other teachers."
<Page9>
As she says this, Noel-sensei slips the mobile phone
she was holding into her suit pocket.
...It didn't look like she making a call or composing
an email. Was she taking a picture of something?
<Page10>
"Well, I can't sneak away from my problems forever, can
I?
I guess I'll give up and head back to the staff room.
But still... . 'Are you lost'? That just cracks me
up! We're at school! Ah, or was that a Japanese pick-up
line?"
<Page11>
"N-No, not at all."
"I know, I know. I'm just messing with you ☆
See you later, Shiki-kun. Thank you for being so
considerate ♥"
<Page12>
Noel-sensei hums as she walks down the stairs.
She really is quite a carefree teacher.
But...
<Page13>
"How did she know my name...?"
Has she already memorized the faces and names of all
the students in the class now that she's our new
homeroom teacher?
I might have misunderstood her. She might really be a
dedicated teacher after all...
