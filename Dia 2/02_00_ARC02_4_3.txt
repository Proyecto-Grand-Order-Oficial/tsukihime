<Page1>
No, I'll just stay in my room.
I'm all relaxed from my bath earlier, it'd be a shame
to lose this feeling of satisfaction by wandering
around.
. I throw myself onto the bed.
<Page2>
"Shiki-sama, are you there?"
"!?"
I leap out of bed again in a panic.
Even though I wasn't doing anything wrong, I still feel
as though I'm being accused of something.
<Page3>
"O-Of course I'm here. Please, come in."
"Yes, excuse me then."
<Page4>
"I am here to make the bed.
I am aware that it is unpleasant for you, but please
excuse me for a moment."
<Page5>
It's not unpleasant at all.
It's a luxury to have someone make the bed in your
room.
However, I've learned over the past two days that
saying so would only trouble her.
<Page6>
"Thank you. I'll just stand quietly in the corner over
here. Please don't mind me and go ahead."
<Page7>
I scurry over to the corner of the room so as not to
get in her way.
"........."
Hisui pauses for a moment, then silently begins and
finishes making the bed.
<Page8>
The bed is as clean and neat as if it were brand new.
"Your bed is ready. Excuse me."
Hisui bows lightly and heads for the door.
<Page9>
"Ah, wait a mi―――"
I call for her to stop so that I can thank her for
making the bed.
I hadn't planned on grabbing her, but I end up reaching
out and touching her shoulder.
<Page10>
In a flash, Hisui's hand knocks mine away.
"Ah..."
I'm surprised, but she looks even more shocked than me.
<Page11>
"...Sorry. I was trying to stop you, I just..."
I guess I'm feeling a little too relaxed after that
bath.
I felt like I was back in the Arima house and misjudged
the distance between us.
<Page12>
"...No. It is I who should apologize.
I am not used to being touched... Please forgive me."
<Page13>
Hisui's shoulders are trembling feebly.
I think that's a bit excessive, but still, I'm the one
who frightened her.
<Page14>
"Anyway, sorry... it's just, I felt like you'd leave if
I didn't stop you."
Hisui would have stopped just because I called out to
her. I wonder why I got the feeling a second ago that
she wasn't going to.
<Page15>
"―――No. You have nothing to apologize for.
It is I who is at fault. Please forgive me for
offending you."
<Page16>
"No, you didn't offend me at all... but I guess I was
really surprised. Hisui, you reacted so fast."
She reacted as fast as a kendo practitioner would.
If this were a dojo, I'd be applauding.
<Page17>
"Well, that is... I guess it is because I take care of
maintaining the mansion."
Hisui lowers her gaze in embarrassment.
...Good. It seems that she understood that I was
praising her.
<Page18>
"...I deeply apologize. I must have not heard you
calling for me earlier.
What can I do for you, Shiki-sama?"
<Page19>
"Ah, well―――"
This doesn't feel like the right time to say 'I just
wanted to thank you for making my bed.'
I need to come up with something else to talk about...
Ah, that's right.
<Page20>
"I was wondering how Akiha is doing. Her school is a
boarding school, right?"
<Page21>
"It is indeed.
It is true that the school Akiha-sama attends is a
boarding school. However, as an exception, she is
allowed to go to school from home."
"...#You mean she commutes all the way to school from
here?"
<Page22>
"Yes, but she is rarely able to make it home before
evening like she did today. Even after a full day of
school, she has additional lessons to attend, so it is
usually at least seven o'clock by the time she returns
to the mansion."
"Additional lessons? Such as...?"
<Page23>
"I believe that today's schedule was a violin lesson,
along with foreign language practice."
Today's schedule...? Is she on such a schedule every
day? I guess our old man always forced her to practice
a lot in the past, so I shouldn't be that surprised,
but...
<Page24>
"In addition, she uses her time before bed to review
and approve the Tohno Group's business report for the
day. Between waking up in the morning and having
breakfast, she will also inspect the business's plans
for the future."
<Page25>
"―――Seriously?"
I'm floored.
It's not just her mind and body that are made of steel,
she's got a lifestyle to match.
<Page26>
"She is able to return before dinner on weekdays, so if
you have something you wish to speak with her about,
please inform Nee-san after dinner.
Akiha-sama may also be able to take some time off if
there is a holiday. For times like those, you can speak
to me directly."
"I-I see. Thanks, that was helpful."
<Page27>
With a bow, Hisui leaves the room.
But then again...
<Page28>
"Violin lessons along with company responsibilities..."
It's probably the higher-ups in each department that
are in charge of keeping the business running, but at
the end of the day, she still has the final say over
all their decisions.
<Page29>
"...I guess that office isn't just for show, huh?"
I feel a mixture of guilt and genuine respect.
<Page30>
The Akiha I remember was a quiet, sheepish girl who
always followed me with anxious eyes.
But now, she's taking over from our old man, while
still managing to live her life as a student.
<Page31>
"―――I guess it's true.
People can change a lot in seven years."
Just as I've become the Tohno Shiki of today in seven
years,
Akiha has become the Tohno Akiha of today in those
seven years.
<Page32>
Seven years is a long time.
Roughly half of my life so far.
I wasn't in this mansion during the most important
period of her life: when she was growing from a child
to an adult.
<Page33>
"...I really am a terrible brother."
I mutter this obvious fact as if to ridicule myself.
Even though I regret it now, it's still unforgivable.
I selfishly wonder if I could have eased Akiha's burden
a little if I had stayed with her these past seven
years.
