I'll take it easy in the cafeteria.
Fortunately, I'm feeling good today.
I'll order the sumptuous 'meal set A' for a change.
I don't usually order it because it's a bit pricy, but
I don't have to worry about my financial situation.

After all, as of yesterday, I am the eldest son of the
Tohno family.
"I want to have the most expensive meal in the
cafeteria every day."
I'm sure that if I were to suggest this to our family
head, she would accept it with a smile.

"Is that so? Then please allow me to provide you with
enough coupons to cover a full month's worth of meals.
After that, I shall contact the school cafeteria, find
out what's on the menu for the month, and then
determine what you will be served. Is that acceptable?"

"...?"
I feel a sudden chill, but decide to think nothing of
it and head for the cafeteria.
I'll just enjoy the freedom to eat whatever I want.
