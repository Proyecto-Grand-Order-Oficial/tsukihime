"――――――"
...The back of my neck feels strangely hot. It's
becoming swollen and numb.
I wonder if that's the reason... I feel like I've lost
track of where I was going.
<Page2>
The night spreads itself over the city like spilled
water.
The hustle and bustle is incomparable to that of the
morning.
The headlights of cars pass by.
Crowds of people are disgorged and then swallowed up
again by the station.
There aren't many school uniforms to be seen now.
The people striding up and down the street are wearing
all manner of clothing.
<Page3>
"――――――"
I stand up from my seat on the bench.
It's about time I get going.
Despite having no reason to go there, I turn and head
downtown.
<Page4>
"――――――"
I duck into a side street off of the main drag.
It's less a street than it is a blind spot between the
buildings.
<Page5>
There's nobody else here.
No noise.
No signs of life.
There's only―――a rustling sound, emanating from deep
within.
<Page6>
The light from the vending machines is blinding.
The superfluous trappings of modern civilization,
incongruous with this place.
They're too dazzling, so I put them behind me.
I proceed into the gloomier, more fitting, darkness of
the night.
<Page7>
...Toward a narrower, more secluded darkness.
I put a hand on the rusty iron fence.
If I open it and go deep enough, I'm sure I'll
find―――
<Page8>
"Hey, you there."
"―――Huh?"
<Page9>
I stop in my tracks.
I've returned to my senses, but I'm still slightly
dizzy.
...I don't know what's going on.
Why did I come to this place?
Why was I trying to continue on into the depths...?
<Page10>
"Sorry. Do you have a hundred yen on you?"
When I turn around, I see an unfamiliar girl in front
of the vending machine.
She's standing there in a way that screams 'I've been
trying to buy some juice... but I'm stuck without any
change.'
<Page11>
"........."
Perhaps because I felt guilty about trying to go deeper
into the alleyway, I just go with the flow and hand
over a hundred yen.
<Page12>
"Thanks. I appreciate it."
She inserts the hundred yen into the vending machine
and presses the button.
The girl takes out the can that the machine dropped.
She frowns, looking disappointed.
<Page13>
"You must be rather carefree to be taking a walk at
this time of night.
Isn't there anyone at home waiting for you?"
"Huh―――yeah...!"
<Page14>
I look at my phone.
The clock mercilessly reports that it's 7:40―――crap,
I only have twenty minutes left before curfew!
<Page15>
Panicking, I start to dash out of the alleyway.
―――And then.
"Hold on a second."
She stops me again.
<Page16>
"What? I'm sorry, but I have to hurry―――"
She throws the can of juice at me.
Flustered, I manage to catch it, but isn't this the one
she bought?
<Page17>
"Here, take it."
"Um... why?"
"I can't stand that flavor."
<Page18>
Sounding displeased, she briskly walks past me.
<Page19>
"N-No, this is no time for me to be standing here in
shock...!"
I need to get a move on too. I break into a run.
Failing to make it back by curfew from day one would be
disastrous, not just as an older brother, but as a
human being. No matter what it takes, I need to get
back to the mansion before the family head's lighting
strikes me down...!
