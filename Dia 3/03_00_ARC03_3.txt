It's before homeroom.
The classroom is livelier than usual.
<Page2>
A fierce dispute is unfolding between the boys and
girls over what to make of Noel-sensei.
Luckily for me, I don't belong to either camp. As such,
I simply saunter across the classroom to my seat, not a
care in the world, when―――
<Page3>
"Yo. You're late, Tohno."
My seat by the window is occupied by a man who doesn't
belong in a classroom this early in the morning,
waiting for me with a smirk on his face.
What's more―――
<Page4>
"Good morning, Tohno-kun."
He is accompanied by an unexpected guest.
<Page5>
"Senpai? Why are you in our classroom?"
<Page6>
"Oh, is it that unusual? I just dropped by to see if
you were here."
"It's pretty unusual. Upperclassmen usually steer clear
of the lower-year classrooms. Doesn't it feel
embarrassing to be so conspicuously out of place?"
<Page7>
"Is that what you're worried about? Tohno-kun, you
really pick up on the little things, don't you? It
doesn't bother me though. We all go to the same school
after all."
What philanthropism. I'm at a loss for words.
<Page8>
"Alright, but the third- and second-year classrooms are
pretty far apart. It's not my fault if you end up late
for homeroom."
'I see', she nods earnestly.
<Page9>
"Don't worry about that. I may not look it, but I'm a
fast runner. I can make it to my classroom downstairs
in under a minute."
, she replies, puffing out her chest.
"......"
Senpai is way too tough, both mentally and physically.
<Page10>
"You talk too much, Tohno.
Why worry about it, she came here because she wanted
to."
<Page11>
Arihiko, true to form, has plopped himself down on
someone's desk and seems to be enjoying chatting with
Senpai.
<Page12>
"Alright then... But you have to go back to your class
two minutes before homeroom starts, Senpai."
I sit down on my chair with a sigh, feeling somewhat
tired all of a sudden.
<Page13>
"...Inui-kun, Tohno-kun seems to be in a bad mood,
doesn't he."
"...Yeah, I think he's throwing a temper tantrum
because the lifestyle at his new place doesn't agree
with him. He can put up with a lot, but he has a bad
habit of lashing out when he comes up against something
he doesn't understand."
<Page14>
"...Is that so? He doesn't seem like the type to get
angry."
<Page15>
"...No, that's not true at all. He may look all docile,
but when he goes off, he  goes off. Happens all
the time. He just snaps."
"...Huh. Snaps, you say?"
<Page16>
"...Yeah, yeah. Once he loses his temper he's
indiscriminate, so you'd better be careful not to let
your guard down around him, Senpai."
...The two of them are whispering 'secretly' to each
other.
<Page17>
"...You know what? If you want to talk in private, can
you do it in the hallway? Overhearing you badmouthing
me from the next desk over is giving me a headache."
"No way!! You could hear me, Tohno!?"
<Page18>
...Of course I could hear you.
Not only could I hear you, but I also saw how you used
talking in secret as an excuse to sidle up to Senpai,
then tried to casually put a hand on her waist and were
mercilessly struck down.
It was such a blatant ploy that it's honestly more
depressing than infuriating.
<Page19>
Speaking of Senpai, she's currently covering her mouth
with her hand in surprise. I can't tell whether she's
being serious or not, though.
...Knowing her, she might really have been trying to
speak in private.
<Page20>
"Oh, this is why you're a liberal arts four-eyes.
Eavesdropping on me and Senpai talking about our love
affair is just beyond pathetic...# Hmm, are your days
really that filled with frustration? Is your new sister
really  beautiful? Can you introduce me to her next
time?"
"Arihiko. Are you seriously trying to pick a fight with
me?"
<Page21>
"Of course not. You and I are the best of friends! I'll
even fight with my parents if they rub me the wrong
way, but I make it a policy never to fight with my best
friend. In short, I'm a man who lives by a code of
chivalry."
<Page22>
I'm amazed.
In his head, it's still perfectly chivalrous to raise
your hand against your own flesh and blood.
<Page23>
"I see. That's a rotten policy you've got there."
"Hey, you're pretending to be down, but you're really
the same old Tohno! Sheesh. You had me worried!"
. My self-proclaimed best friend hits me on the
back.
<Page24>
"...Don't tell me you've actually been looking out for
me?"
"Don't ask such a silly question, dummy.
Isn't it noble to do such things casually?"
. He hits me on the back again.
...We've known each other for a long time, but I still
don't have a handle on this guy's personality.
<Page25>
"So, how's the new house?
From the looks of it, you're under a lot of stress."
"Man, where to begin. For starters, I had this strange
dream last night and when I told the people I live with
about it, they didn't believe me."
"Hmm. I see, that's unfortunate."
Arihiko makes a serious face and nods.
<Page26>
"............"
―――And then.
I thought that Senpai had just been staying out of our
trivial conversation, but she's actually been watching
Arihiko and me like a hawk the entire time.
<Page27>
"Senpai?"
"Tohno-kun, you're really close with Inui-kun, aren't
you?"
"Are you serious? If that's your takeaway from all
this, then there must be something wrong with your
glasses."
<Page28>
"That's not true. You're much more open when you're
with Inui-kun. You seem to trust him a great deal."
For some reason, Senpai smiles happily.
"Hm?"
Arihiko and I look at each other and tilt our heads.
<Page29>
"I really envy you. I wish I had friends that could
understand each other like that without getting all
worked up."
Senpai sighs admiringly.
""Is that so?""
Arihiko and I look at each other, furrowing our brows.
<Page30>
"Oops, it seems it's about that time. I need to head
back, but before I do―――Tohno-kun, did you see the
news this morning?"
"Oh... I've been so busy that I forgot. I haven't seen
it yet."
<Page31>
"I see. Well, forgive me for being direct, but there
was a large mansion on the news this morning. Is that
your new house?"
"Huh?"
<Page32>
Now that she mentions it, I remember Hisui saying that
the police came by to question us.
<Page33>
"Ah, yeah, that's definitely my house.
I heard that the police came by to talk to us this
morning."
"I see. Tohno-kun, you shouldn't play around too much
at night."
<Page34>
Senpai walks away at a brisk pace.
We watch her depart in silence.
<Page35>
"Hmm. Hmmmm.
―――Hey, Tohno."
"What do you want? If it's something stupid then I'm
not listening."
"It's not stupid. What I'm dying to know is, when did
you become so close with Senpai that she started coming
to see you?"
<Page36>
"I don't really have a great answer for you. We only
started talking a couple of days ago, and she just came
here on a whim today, right?
Not to mention that you seemed pretty friendly with her
yourself."
"Not really. It took a whole week just to get to the
point where she remembers my name."
<Page37>
"Oho, well this is unusual. Isn't it your policy to
avoid dealing with women who don't fall for you in a
day because they're a pain in the ass?"
<Page38>
"If they're an ordinary woman, sure. But Senpai is
different.
I've been keeping it a secret, but the truth is, she's
just my type."
"You're saying you like older women who look good in
glasses, right?"
Arihiko's cheeks redden.
<Page39>
"You could tell, buddy?"
"I could. Senpai said you and I are best friends, and
while I think that's pushing it, I can still tell when
you're serious.
She's really cute. It'd be weird if you chatted with
her for a while and  come away interested. I'm no
exception."
<Page40>
"I see, I see.
So you understand how great she is as well―――wait.#
What did you just say?"
"Being best friends means that we get along, but it
also means we've got similar interests. It's not
surprising that we share a type."
<Page41>
We stare at each other for a while.
Finally, Arihiko nods solemnly and says―――
"It was a short friendship, Tohno."
"Yeah, it was."
I see him off with a wave of my hand.
As I do, the bell sounds for the start of homeroom.
