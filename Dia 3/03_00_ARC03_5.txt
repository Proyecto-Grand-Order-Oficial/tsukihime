Fifth period.
The lesson on classical literature is putting me to
sleep, but I keep on writing in my notebook.
Our high school has yet to approve the use of
electronic devices for note-taking. They say they plan
to eventually move to using tablets, but that seems to
be a few years out still.
<Page2>
That said, if you do use your phone in class you aren't
likely to get in trouble for it. It's an unspoken
agreement.
Even now, there are a handful of students using their
cell phones to read dictionaries, exchange texts, and
browse websites.
I'm more of an analog person myself, so I do it the
old-fashioned way and write my notes by ha―――
<Page3>
"――――"
It happened suddenly.
My senses intensify as though accelerating.
My field of view rolls up, twists and folds in on
itself until it's just a point.
I feel so off-balance it's as though my brain itself is
spinning in circles.
<Page4>
My vision wavers.
I feel as though something is festering at the back of
my head, and that my consciousness is about to tumble
out of my skull.
<Page5>
"...Not... good..."
I know this feeling.
This sudden dizziness marks the onset of a bout of
anemia.
...How careless of me. I let my guard down despite
knowing this could happen to my body at any time.
<Page6>
I hate this... I've mostly managed to avoid collapsing
in class, but―――
<Page7>
As my vision grows dark, I reach out and latch onto my
desk to steady myself.
But it's all in vain.
I can't put any strength into my fingertips.
All that's left is for me to collapse to the
floor―――
<Page8>
"Sensei, you got a sec?"
―――And then.
. Someone hits me on the back roughly.
<Page9>
"Tohno doesn't seem to be feeling well, so I'd like to
take him to the infirmary."
Arihiko had shown up without me noticing.
"Tohno, are you feeling unwell?"
I hear the teacher's voice from the podium.
<Page10>
"No, it's nothing reall―――"
"Ah, no, he's a complete wreck.
Shouldn't you send him home early?"
...Arihiko just goes and loudly speaks over me.
<Page11>
"Is that so? I've heard about Tohno's condition. Tohno,
if you're not feeling well, feel free to either rest in
the infirmary or head home early."
...Maybe he's a good person after all.
The literature teacher seems to completely believe
Arihiko's words.
<Page12>
"Come on, you can go home now. You're so pale, man. No
one's going to know you're feeling unwell unless you
say something, you know."
Arihiko pats me on the back reproachfully.
"...In that case, I'm going to leave early then,
Sensei."
'Mmm', the literature teacher nods solemnly.
<Page13>
"...Sorry, Arihiko. For making you worry like this."
"Don't worry about it. We've been inseparable since
middle school. I can tell right away when you're about
to keel over from anemia."
<Page14>
Arihiko goes back to his seat.
I somehow manage to stumble to my feet, and drag my
leaden body from the classroom.
<Page15>
I leave the school building.
I thought about going to the infirmary to rest, but if
I went there at this hour there's a high possibility
that I'd fall asleep until nighttime.
For that reason, I decided it'd be better if I head
back to the mansion, even if it means pushing myself a
little.
<Page16>
"... I think I'm feeling a little better."
As I breathe in the outside air, I begin to feel
rejuvenated.
<Page17>
Seven years ago.
Maybe it's the price I have to pay in exchange for
recovering from an accident that almost killed me, but
ever since that incident, I've suffered from chronic
anemia.
<Page18>
When I was first discharged from the hospital, I'd
suffer from an attack almost every day.
I missed out on a lot of things as a result of my
condition, but thanks to the people around me, it was
never a big deal.
<Page19>
Now that I've grown up a bit, those symptoms are a lot
less frequent――provided I avoid excessive physical
activity.
Even so, I can't stop myself from getting dizzy and
losing consciousness occasionally.
I got lucky today in that Arihiko called out to me
midway, I'd normally have fainted under those
circumstances.
<Page20>
"――――――"
I take a slow, deep breath, letting the fresh air fill
my lungs.
Doing my best to ignore the lingering feeling of
something festering inside my head, I leave the school.
<Page21>
I step out into the street in front of the station.
...I can't believe it. This proves that I'm still in a
daze.
I almost went into the ticket gate out of habit.
<Page22>
The Arima household isn't my home anymore. The Tohno
mansion is. There's no longer a reason for me to take
the train from here.
<Page23>
"――――."
I'm still not feeling well.
I put my hand on my forehead and find that it's hotter
than usual.
<Page24>
If I push myself too hard and collapse on the side of
the road, I'll be even worse off than when I started.
"...I guess I don't have a choice, do I?"
I sit down on a bench, disgusted with myself.
I'm going to take a break until I've calmed down a bit.
