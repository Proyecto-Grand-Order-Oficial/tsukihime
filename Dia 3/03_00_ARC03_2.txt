"Hey, Akiha.
About last night, is it like that here every night?"
"―――What?"
"Like I said, I'm talking about last night.
You and the others couldn't sleep either, right?"
"I slept fine last night... what are you referring to?"
"What do you mean what am I referring to? I'm talking
about that dog, what else?
Some stray dog was barking its head off around eleven
o'clock last night, didn't you hear it?"
Akiha and Kohaku-san exchange glances and then stare at
me with a concerned look in their eyes.
...I can't believe this, they're acting like they think
I'm some sort of sleepwalker.
<Page2>
"Fine, I won't ask you.
Kohaku-san, it was making a real racket outside last
night, wasn't it?"
<Page3>
"―――Hmm... That doesn't ring any bells.
It's true that it was windy last night, but the only
unusual thing we found during our midnight patrol was
that you were asleep on top of your bed in your
uniform."
"...Ah, yeah, about that. I'll be more careful from now
on."
<Page4>
"What? Did something happen, Kohaku?"
"Oh no, nothing major.
Shiki-san had just tossed and turned a bit in bed,
that's all."
<Page5>
With a smile on her face, Kohaku-san dodges Akiha's
question.
<Page6>
"...Did neither of you really notice anything?
Some stray dog was barking for almost half an hour last
night.    , it was so loud."
<Page7>
"Aha, you mean like the ones in  , right?"
I can't quite tell by her reaction whether she believes
me or not.
<Page8>
"...Well, I guess you could describe it that way."
"Hmmm―――I don't remember anything like that, though.
Neither do you, right, Kohaku?"
<Page9>
"I suppose not... I'm sorry, Shiki-san, but I don't
think that happened."
<Page10>
"That settles it, then. Don't you think it's also
possible that Nii-san was simply dreaming of a dog
barking at him?"
"......."
<Page11>
Now that both of them have denied it, I'm no longer so
sure about it myself.
...Thinking back on it, it doesn't make any sense that
I'd be able to hear howling. There weren't any dogs
outside, and the street―――
<Page12>
I'm pretty sure there was nobody in the street.
I'm starting to believe that what they said is true.
Maybe it really  a dream.
<Page13>
"I'm sure your bad dreams are just a side effect of not
being used to the mansion yet.
Well, if the wild dogs continue to bark tonight,
perhaps we should get a ferocious guard dog of our
own."
A sadistic smile plays across Akiha's lips.
<Page14>
"Excuse me, but it's time for me to take my leave.
Nii-san, please be careful not to get attacked by dogs
on your way to school."
<Page15>
Akiha gracefully leaves the living room.
After giving me a small bow, Kohaku also leaves the
living room in order to go see her master off.
