After having breakfast in the dining room, I go out to
the lobby.
Hisui trails after me, carrying my bag.
I'd told her I was capable of handling my own bag, but
she insisted on carrying it at least as far as the
door.
<Page2>
...I seem to have a weak spot not only for Akiha, but
Hisui as well.
Hmm, on second thought, it would be more accurate to
say I have a  spot for Hisui.
<Page3>
I end up losing to Akiha because everything she says is
correct, and so I can't come up with any valid
counterarguments. It also doesn't help that Tohno Akiha
simply outranks Tohno Shiki.
<Page4>
But Hisui is the complete opposite.
I'm technically in a position of power over her, but I
don't think I can actually wield that power to my
advantage.
I don't know why, but when she stares at me, I feel
like listening to whatever she has to say...
<Page5>
"Shiki-san, Shiki-san! Please wait a minute!#"
Kohaku-san comes rushing down from the second floor
with a patter of footsteps.
"............"
Hisui steps aside as soon as Kohaku-san arrives.
<Page6>
"Wait, I thought you were with Akiha?"
"Akiha-sama is being taken to school by car.
I stayed behind because I needed to deliver something
to you."
<Page7>
"A delivery? For me?"
"Yes. Yesterday, I received a package from the Arima
family."
Kohaku-san gives me a wide grin.
<Page8>
"Hmm? I brought all my stuff with me though.
Everything I used over there originally belonged to the
Arima family. The only things that belong to me are the
clothes on my back..."
<Page9>
"Are you sure? Here is the package that was delivered."
Kohaku-san hands me a thin wooden box, about twenty
centimeters long.
It doesn't weigh much.
<Page10>
"―――Kohaku-san. I've never seen this before."
"I believe this was one of your father's belongings.
Apparently he left it to you in his will."
<Page11>
"...My father left this to me?"
...It's not really sinking in.
Why would Tohno Makihisa, the man who kicked me out of
this mansion seven years ago, leave me a parting gift?
<Page12>
"Well, whatever. Kohaku-san, can you take this to my
room?"
"―――――"
Kohaku-san is staring intently at the wooden box.
She's acting like a child with her heart set on a toy.
<Page13>
"."
No, she  a child.
<Page14>
"...Okay, I get it. You want to know what's inside,
don't you?"
"No, not at all.
I'm just a little curious as to what kind of gift it
is."
...No, you're more than just a little curious,
Maid-san.
<Page15>
"Alright, I'll open it. Ready? Open."
The wooden box opens with a soft, dry sound.
Inside is a thin iron rod, about fifteen centimeters
long.
<Page16>
"It's... an iron rod."
An unadorned iron rod that looks like it's seen regular
use.
<Page17>
...My father must have really hated me if this antique
is all he left me as a memento.
Plus, I'm pretty sure the iron bars my father worked
with were thicker and more rugged―――
<Page18>
"I'm not so sure, Shiki-san.
This is a fruit knife, isn't it?"
Kohaku-san takes the iron rod out of the box.
<Page19>
"You know, the ones with blades that pop out?
This looks a lot like one of those. Okay, here we go."
<Page20>
. A blade about ten centimeters long springs out.
...Huh, it really is a knife.
<Page21>
"The mechanism inside is modern, but the exterior seems
to be quite old. See, it has the year and era engraved
on the underside here."
<Page22>
Kohaku-san retracts the blade and hands me the knife.
...She's right, there are some words carved into the
bottom of the grip.
The character for 'seven', and next to it, the
character for 'night'.
<Page23>
"Nee-san, there is no era by that name.
It just says ."
"Gah...!"
Wheeling around, I see that Hisui has been silently
peering at the knife from behind me this entire time.
<Page24>
"Y-You surprised me... don't scare me like that, Hisui.
You don't have to look over my shoulder like that. If
you wanna see, here."
<Page25>
"Ah―――――――"
<Page26>
"P-Please excuse me.
Um―――that dagger is so beautiful, I couldn't
resist."
"I dunno if I'd use the word 'beautiful'.
If anything, the design strikes me as somewhat bland
and old-fashioned."
<Page27>
"That is not true at all. I think it is an antique with
a lot of history."
"...Really? It looks like a piece of junk to me..."
<Page28>
After hearing Hisui say that with such conviction, I'm
beginning to feel the same way.
...Yeah.
Maybe this isn't such a bad memento after all.
<Page29>
"Hmm, 'Nanatsu-yoru'... Could that be the name of this
fruit knife?"
I don't think many people name their knives... whatever
it is, it's definitely an antique.
<Page30>
I retract the blade and put the knife in my bag. It's a
violation of the Weapons Act, but hopefully the
authorities will let it slide just for today.
I'll show it to Arihiko later and brag about it...
well, if he's at school that is.
<Page31>
"Shiki-sama. Are you alright for time...?"
"Crap. I'd better get going or I'm gonna be late.
I'm off, Kohaku-san. Thanks for the delivery."
'No problem.' says Kohaku-san, waving us off.
<Page32>
Exiting the front gate of the mansion, I notice an
unusual flurry of activity.
<Page33>
"...What's going on here? What's all the fuss about?"
"About that... It appears they found some blood on the
road this morning."
"Blood...? You mean... like, bloodstains?"
<Page34>
"Yes, there was also blood on the wall around our
property.
It seems that while you were asleep, the police came to
inquire about what happened last night."
<Page35>
"Does that mean that somebody died...?"
"No, all they found were bloodstains."
"――――――"
<Page36>
The road that runs along the east side of the
property―――that's the area I went to check on last
night.
Bloodstains... clinging spatters of crimson.
There were no signs of that conspicuous color last
night, at any rate.
There was only black. Only the biting cold. Not even
the slightest hint of the warmth of blood existed.
<Page37>
"Shiki-sama?"
"......No, it's nothing.
I'll see you later. Thanks for seeing me off."
<Page38>
"Have a good day. I wish you safe travels."
<Page39>
Hisui bows deeply.
I'm only going to school, so I don't think I have that
much to worry about. Still, I'm sure Hisui is just
concerned about my health in her own way.
<Page40>
"Thank you. I'll try to be careful. Take care of
yourself, Hisui."
With a quick wave of my hand, I thank Hisui and leave
the main gate behind.
