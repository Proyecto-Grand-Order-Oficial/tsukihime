"Good morning, both of you."
"Good morning, Shiki-san."
Kohaku-san returns my greeting with a smile as
brilliant as her white apron.

Akiha, on the other hand, glances at me and says―――
"You don't seem to be in much of a hurry this morning,
Nii-san.
I'm sure this isn't the case, but you're not mistaking
today for a holiday, are you?"
It may be early in the morning, but she still isn't
pulling any punches.

"Not in a hurry? It's just turned seven, I have plenty
of time.
It only takes around half an hour to walk to school
from here, so I'd say I got up early today if
anything."
"In other words, you barely have ten minutes to eat
breakfast? You are not a starving dog, you should take
your time with a meal."

She calls out my inadequacies with pinpoint
precision... I have no choice but to acknowledge her
formidable quick wit and supernatural reflexes.
She's just like a flat wall constantly repelling the
ball during tennis practice. I'm not going to say which
part is the wall though.

"...Nii-san.
Were you about to say something strange just now?"
"No, nothing. Really, nothing.
Besides, what did you mean by 'I'm not a dog',
Akiha―――"
<Page6>
Actually, that reminds me.
Speaking of dogs, I need to ask about what happened
last night.
