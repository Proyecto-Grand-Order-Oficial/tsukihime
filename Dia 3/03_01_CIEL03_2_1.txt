...I'll eat in the classroom.
However, I just don't have an appetite today.
If I force myself to eat when I'm feeling this way,
I'll just end up being sick later, so I think I'm
better off just using this time to rest...
<Page2>
"Hey Tohno, c'mon let's go get some food."
"―――"
Any appetite I may have had disappears the second I see
his ugly mug.
That settles it, I'll skip lunch today. Thanks a lot
for the excuse, Arihiko.
<Page3>
"Sorry, I'll pass today. Go ahead without me."
"What the hell, you're getting more unhealthy by the
day!
What, does your new life as an aristocrat not suit you
after all?"
<Page4>
"You know, I'm not an aristocrat... Ah, well, maybe
you're right. If I'm not considered an aristocrat, then
who is?
The bathrooms in the mansion are huge, Arihiko. They're
bigger than your room. And more expensive too."
"Seriously!? I'd never be able to feel comfortable
living like that."
<Page5>
...I take back my earlier comment.
It's a relief to hear a response like that. Thank you,
Arihiko.
I feel a little better after hearing something that I
can agree with so wholeheartedly.
<Page6>
"...Well, it's not just the building that's hard to
adjust to.
Even if I wake up at seven o'clock in the morning they
grouse about me being late, and curfew is at eight
o'clock in the evening. To make matters worse, if I
spend the night somewhere else without prior permission
I'll get interrogated afterward. It's like living in a
prison, right?"
<Page7>
"Oh? Hey, that doesn't sound too bad.
I've got nothing but praise for that sort of
micromanagement. Young people need more structure in
their lives. If they spend all their time messing
around, they'll never become decent adults."
"I feel the same way, though somehow it's more
convincing coming from you."
He is, after all, the ultimate proof by contradiction.
<Page8>
"Is that so? You're being awfully obedient today,
Tohno.
Good boy, let me give you some sweet bread as a treat!"
"Like I said, I don't need any food. Ignore me and just
eat. Lunchtime's almost over."
<Page9>
"Really?# Well, I'll be digging in then."
Arihiko clasps his hands together and then starts to
tuck into his bread.
Despite his appearance, he really seems like a man who
 his meals.
<Page10>
"Pardon me!"
And then...
Senpai shows up with what looks like a lunchbox in her
hand.
<Page11>
"Oh? Senpai, I thought you usually ate in the
cafeteria?"
"No, I don't really have a fixed lunchtime routine. It
all depends on how I'm feeling on a given day."
<Page12>
She takes her lunch out of a cute drawstring pouch.
It seems to be a little on the large side for a girl.
<Page13>
"Let me guess, you managed to wake up early today and
felt like making a packed lunch, right?"
<Page14>
"Yes, I woke up a little before seven this morning,
which is unusual for me―――
Wait a minute, what are you making me say, Tohno-kun!?"
<Page15>
"Ah, that wasn't my intention... Senpai, are you not a
morning person?"
"Yes. The truth is, I'm pretty bad at waking up early.
I have to push myself pretty hard to make it on time
when I'm volunteering."
<Page16>
"My parents ran a bakery, so we always had to get up
incredibly early every day. But, no matter how hard I
tried, I always struggled to wake up in the mornings.
It drove my father mad the entire time I was growing
up."
<Page17>
What? A bakery!?
Arihiko and I look at each other. I bet he's also
imagining Ciel-senpai with an oven in her room,
kneading and baking flour with her white fingers.
<Page18>
"My battle with my father lasted for about three years,
but in the end he said———
'I would rather do the work of two people than train
you!'
Then he threw me out of the kitchen.
Ever since, I've been able to be as self-indulgent as I
want about when I choose to wake up."
<Page19>
Ciel-senpai puffs out her chest, looking quite pleased
with herself.
"Is that so? That's kind of surprising.
You always struck me as a very capable person."
<Page20>
"Yes, I try my best not to screw up in front of you. If
pressed to choose, I'd have to say I lean more toward
being a clumsy person than a capable one."
<Page21>
...It's certainly possible that she's actually a bit of
a klutz.
I guess the fact she does volunteer work is a bit of a
giveaway.
A capable individual wouldn't spend their time on
something they don't stand to gain any benefit from.
<Page22>
"I see. To be honest, I prefer clumsy people.
I feel like I can actually relax around them."
Arihiko nods in agreement.
"So, I suppose a late riser such as yourself ends up
eating in the cafeteria most days?"
<Page23>
"Yeah, I end up eating in the cafeteria more than I'd
like to admit. I still manage to make my own lunch like
this every now and again though. Not that it's anything
special, just a bunch of pre-prepared dishes.
You two are members of the school cafeteria faction,
aren't you?"
<Page24>
"No, we also just go when the mood takes us. My sister
used to pack a lunch for me back when I was a freshman,
but Tohno would always eat in the cafeteria or get
bread so I ended up just doing whatever he did."
<Page25>
"Huh, Tohno-kun is a pretty fickle guy, isn't he?"
"Yeah, you'll only get worn out if you go out with guys
like him, so watch out, Senpai."
<Page26>
Senpai agrees with Arihiko and opens the lid of her
lunchbox.
The contents of her round lunchbox are an even split
between rice and side dishes. It's a very orthodox
lunchbox, but there does seem to be rather a lot of
food inside.
<Page27>
"Well then, let's eat.
Is it alright if I borrow your neighbor's chair?"
"An empty chair belongs to everyone.
I'm sure Takada-kun would love to have you sit in his
seat."
<Page28>
Senpai begins to eat, opting to keep her lunchbox on
her lap rather than place it on my desk.
Standing diagonally across from her is Arihiko,
unwrapping his second piece of bread.
As I watch the two of them out of the corner of my eye,
I gaze idly at the scenery out the window.
<Page29>
"Huh? Tohno-kun, aren't you going to eat?"
"No, I don't feel like it today."
<Page30>
"You're not eating... You're going to get hungry, you
know."
"It's fine. I'm more concerned with my health than my
appetite. Besides, I'm not so weak that I can't handle
skipping lunch."
<Page31>
"Wow, that's amazing. I can't function if I skip even a
single meal. I get so hungry that I just collapse.
...It's a little embarrassing. Even though I eat a lot
more than most people, I still get hungry again right
away."
<Page32>
"Don't even worry about it. You're a lot more developed
than the other girls.# It's one of the laws of nature
that the larger they get the less fuel efficient you
can be."
<Page33>
I'm not sure how I feel about Arihiko's statement, but
he handled the situation well.
Since she  still growing, I want her to continue to
eat and reach her full potential.
I can't tell from Senpai's expression whether she's
ashamed of or embarrassed by Arihiko's words.
<Page34>
"But Tohno-kun, are you sure you'll be okay if you skip
lunch?"
"It's fine, it's fine. It's not unusual for me to go
all day without eating anything. I even ate breakfast
today, so I'll be fine until evening."
<Page35>
". I don't think that's a good idea.
You'll ruin your body if you live like that."
<Page36>
"Don't worry, there are people who check up on me.
My doctor has actually warned me not to put on any
weight, so it's honestly in my best interests if I skip
a meal every now and then.
I'd like to get stronger, but keeping my weight under
control takes priority."
<Page37>
"I-I see.
Even boys think about dieting, don't they."
<Page38>
Senpai looks at me a little sheepishly for some reason,
then after pausing to think for a moment closes the lid
of her lunchbox.
<Page39>
"Um, I just remembered an errand I have to run, so if
you'll excuse me.
Don't mind me; in fact, I'd rather you forgot about
today's conversation."
<Page40>
After quickly cleaning up, Senpai rushes out of the
room like the wind.
<Page41>
"―――Yep, cute."
Arihiko nods his head in satisfaction, as though moved
by something he just saw.
