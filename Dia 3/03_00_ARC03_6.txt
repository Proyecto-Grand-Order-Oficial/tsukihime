...I can hear the sounds of rain coming from somewhere.
It's a prolonged, quiet drizzle.
<Page2>
"―――――"
I'm dizzy.
My throat hurts when I breathe.
"It... hurts."
I manage to raise my voice.
"――――Shiki-sama?"
Immediately after, I hear someone's voice, and sense
their presence nearby―――
<Page3>
"This is―――my room."
I'm not sure how I got here, but I'm lying down in my
own room.
I take my glasses from the nightstand and put them on.
<Page4>
"Good evening, Shiki-sama."
"Hisui...?"
"Yes. How are you feeling?"
"......"
<Page5>
Hisui asks me a strange question.
There's nothing particularly wrong with my body―――
<Page6>
"Wh―――y?"
Yes, why?
Why am I sleeping in a place like this―――?
<Page7>
"I―――that woman―――I ki―――"
I almost said 'I killed her', but I shut my mouth.
That's the one word my sense of reason won't let me
say.
<Page8>
"Hisui... why am I here?"
"...Do you not remember, Shiki-sama?"
Hisui frowns imperceptibly.
<Page9>
"We received a call from the school saying that you had
left early. However, when evening fell and you still
had not returned home, my sister went to look for you.
Apparently, she found you resting in the park."
"The park―――You mean the park nearby?"
<Page10>
"Yes. You had taken a moment to rest on the bench, and
afterward you returned to the mansion on your own two
feet."
"...No way. I don't remember any of that."
<Page11>
"I do not think it's particularly strange for your
memories to be hazy.
It seems you were feeling faint following the onset of
your anemia, so your consciousness may also have been
clouded at the time."
<Page12>
"........."
...I really don't remember any of that.
Still, there's no reason to doubt anything Hisui said.
<Page13>
"...Ah, it's already nine o'clock in the evening. ...I
can't believe I don't remember anything."
"Yes. After you returned, you said nothing other than
that you wanted to sleep and then went to rest in your
room. I tried to call for a doctor, but you said, 'This
happens all the time'."
<Page14>
"―――I see.
It's true that it isn't unusual for me to collapse from
anemia, but―――"
<Page15>
...This time was different.
I killed someone―――wait, hold on.
<Page16>
"Hisui. How did I look?"
"―――I'm sorry?"
"I mean my clothes. My shirt, my shoes, was there any
blood―――"
They'd all been wet and sticky with it.
<Page17>
"If you are talking about your uniform, it was dirty so
I washed it."
"You're telling me you washed such blood-soaked
clothes...?!"
<Page18>
"...It's true that they were covered in mud, but I
didn't see anything resembling a bloodstain. In
addition, only your shirt and pants were dirty. Your
jacket was practically spotless."
<Page19>
"――――――"
...Unbelievable.
Even though I was kneeling in a sea of blood and my
legs and arms were bright red...?
<Page20>
"Shiki-sama, did you have some sort of bad dream?
You seemed like you were having a nightmare earlier,
and your face is still a little pale."
Hisui is staring intently at my face.
<Page21>
"That was―――a dream?"
Was it all a dream?
That feeling?
The smell of blood?
That ethereal woman in white?
"Yeah―――you're right. That must have all been a bad
dream."
<Page22>
I let out a long sigh.
――――That's right.
It was all a bad dream.
There's no way I'd senselessly go and break the promise
I made to Sensei when I was little. Not without having
even a single reason to.
<Page23>
"Ah――――I'm awake now."
"If you're feeling up to it, I will have dinner
prepared for you."
<Page24>
"Huh... no, dinner would be..."
...I know it was only a dream, but I still can't get
the color and the smell of that blood out of my head.
<Page25>
"I'm sorry, I'm not feeling up to it.
I'll just go to sleep without eating tonight. More
importantly, Hisui―――"
"Yes, what is it, Shiki-sama?"
"Um, well... You told me that I came back in the
evening. Did Akiha say anything?"
<Page26>
"Akiha-sama had not yet returned at the time. She only
came home about two hours ago, and it was then that I
informed her of your condition."
<Page27>
'What about it?' Hisui asks silently.
<Page28>
"It's nothing, really.
It's just that I've barely been back three days and I'm
already causing problems for her. I'm sure she's sick
of me already."
<Page29>
"...While it is true that Akiha-sama's mood worsened on
hearing the news, it did not appear that she is sick of
you."
After saying that, Hisui takes a step back.
<Page30>
"Now, if you will excuse me.
If you need anything else, please let me know."
<Page31>
"I will, thank you. Oh―――I forgot to ask you
something."
"Yes, what is it, Shiki-sama?"
"It's raining outside, isn't it? I was wondering when
it started."
"It started before you arrived. When my sister found
you, you were soaked."
<Page32>
"........."
I see. I can't even remember something as simple as
that.
It must have been a pretty severe bout of anemia... If
I knew things were going to turn out like this, I'd
have just rested at school instead of pushing myself.
<Page33>
"Good night. I'm really sorry about today.
Please tell Kohaku-san I said thanks."
"Understood. Please have a good night."
<Page34>
"―――. So it was all a dream."
...The words I muttered were utterly hollow.
I just can't convince myself that they're true.
I can't believe the events that took place in that
dream―――
Nor can I believe that it was actually a dream at all.
<Page35>
I hear the soft hiss of the rain falling outside.
My head still feels a little heavy.
I happen to glance at my chest.
...The scars I got seven years look like burn marks,
still clearly visible on my skin.
<Page36>
"...Ah."
The knife I received as a memento from my father is
sitting on top of the desk.
"―――――"
...It was all a dream.
What else could it have been but a dream.
I close my eyes, still repeating those words over and
over in my mind, as if to trick myself into believing
them.
<Page37>
...I breathe out, a long slow breath, as though trying
to clear my lungs of that scent.
I surrender myself to a dark sleep that cuts off my
consciousness.
<Page38>
Back when I was a child―――
I think someone told me not to tell lies that I
couldn't even fool myself with.
