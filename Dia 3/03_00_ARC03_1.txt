Sensei once told me something.
She said that the things my eyes can see are the lines
along which things can easily come apart.
To use the body as an analogy, they're like joints
prone to fracturing.
Or soft eyeballs.
<Page2>
If I put my blade in and slice through them, no force
is required.
There's no friction and they don't put up any
resistance. You can cut through anything this way.
They aren't limited to the human body either―――
These 'lines' appear equally on everything I can see,
whether it be vegetable, animal, or mineral.
<Page3>
"Listen carefully, Shiki.
All things are destined to break. So long as something
has a form, it can't escape from that fate, can it?"
<Page4>
In other words, if the world itself is also full of
cracks, it wouldn't be that surprising if it fell apart
one day as well.
That is, so long as the Earth itself also has lines
running across it.
There's a chance that someday, for no real reason at
all, the ground could split apart, and everything on it
would be destroyed.
At least, in the world I see, there's always that
possibility.
<Page5>
"We humans are even more fragile.
Injury and recovery, growing up and getting old,
prosperity and decay; these are all processes that
bring us closer to the end."
<Page6>
When I understood the meaning of her words, gratitude
for the glasses Sensei had given me welled up in my
chest.
I mean, it's a natural reaction. It's not a pleasant
thought, but if I'd had to keep seeing those lines all
the time I wouldn't have been able to go on living.
<Page7>
The lines along which things can easily break.
A world where nothing is firmly bound.
Even if you could see them―――
There isn't even a single thing to be gained from doing
so.
<Page8>
"―――."
I awake from my reverie.
Sensing the morning light on my closed eyelids, I keep
my eyes closed as I run my hand over the nightstand.
<Page9>
...Huh... where are my glasses...?
Feeling uneasy, I grope around the right-hand side of
the bed just in case, and immediately find them.
<Page10>
I usually keep them on the left-hand side... Given how
bad my headache was last night, I suppose it's not out
of the question that I mixed them up.
<Page11>
"...Ah."
I put on my glasses before opening my eyelids.
If someone were watching, they may think it's a strange
habit, but I like to avoid looking at the lines as much
as possible.
<Page12>
"Good morning, Shiki-sama."
"?"
<Page13>
Turning to face the source of the sound, I see a girl
in a maid's uniform standing by the wall.
She's so unobtrusive that I didn't even notice her, but
it seems she's been there for a while.
She must have come to wake me so that I wouldn't
oversleep, same as she did yesterday.
<Page14>
"Ah. Sorry, I shouldn't be so surprised.
Good morning, Hisui. Thank you for coming to wake me
up."
<Page15>
"This is one of my duties, please pay me no mind."
<Page16>
Hisui solemnly bows.
...But, as she does so, she suddenly stops moving and
swiftly raises her head.
<Page17>
"No, my duties do not include surprising you.
―――I will make every effort not to startle you
tomorrow."
<Page18>
...She's a maid with something subtly off about her,
but I can't quite put my finger on it.
She's able to perform her duties as a servant
flawlessly, but I get the sense that she isn't really
accustomed to socializing.
<Page19>
"No, I don't think you did anything wrong.
It's my fault for still not being used to it."
<Page20>
When I get out of bed, I realize that I'm wearing my
pajamas.
...If I remember correctly, last night I changed into
my school uniform because of the howling... and after I
came back, I thought I collapsed straight into bed...?
<Page21>
"...That's weird. I thought I fell asleep in my
uniform."
<Page22>
"That is correct. It would have been bad for your
health if you stayed like that, so I asked Nee-san to
come and change you into your pajamas."
<Page23>
Hisui explains the situation as if it were nothing out
of the ordinary.
I see. She changed my clothes for me.
Sleeping in your uniform won't necessarily make you
sick, but it will make your uniform all wrinkled, and
there's no denying that pajamas are more comfortable.
That attention to detail is just what you'd expect from
a pro―――wait a minute.
<Page24>
"Changed my clothes?"
I hurriedly examine my pants and underwear.
The pants are from a brand new set of pajamas, and my
underwear also seems to be fresh off the rack.
<Page25>
"Hisui."
"Yes, what is it?"
"I'm glad you're concerned about me, but in the future
please do whatever you can to wake me up... changing
clothes is, you know, something I should be doing
myself."
<Page26>
I'm so embarrassed by what's happened that I can't help
but avert my gaze. Hisui simply nods at me, her
expression blank.
<Page27>
"Your school uniform is folded over there.
Once you are dressed, please come to the living room."
<Page28>
".... Normally I would've been woken up by that,
but I must have been really tired last night..."
<Page29>
Dwelling on the past isn't going to change anything.
I should get dressed quickly and have breakfast.
My school uniform is neatly folded and the shirt is
crisply ironed.
When I put my arm through the sleeve, it feels like
it's brand new.
<Page30>
Akiha and Kohaku-san are in the living room.
Akiha seems to have already finished her breakfast and
is elegantly enjoying some tea.
I―――
C:> Greet Akiha.
C:> Greet Kohaku-san.
C:> Greet them both.
