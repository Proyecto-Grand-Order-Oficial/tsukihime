<Page1>
...This is just a bad dream.
But then, why is the smell of blood so horribly real?
<Page2>
"...It's no...t true."
Not true  Not true  Not true  Not true.
Not true  Not true  Not true  Not true.
What's not true? That I killed her?
Or that I didn't kill her?
<Page3>
"But... I didn't have any reason to."
No, I know perfectly well what the reason was.
When I looked at her, I could only think of one thing.
<Page4>
"I――――"
Yes, I―――
        Tohno Shiki wanted to kill that woman.
<Page5>
At the time, it was all I could think about.
I just didn't try to put that feeling into words
because the inside of my head was mush.
<Page6>
"It's not―――――true."
The smell of blood is making me nauseous.
"―――."
The contents of my stomach start to rise back up.
<Page7>
"―――."
The vermilion seeps into my eyeballs.
I feel dizzy, as though my brain itself is shaking.
Nauseous and lightheaded, I fall to my knees in a sea
of red blood.
<Page8>
"――――"
Gastric juices well up in my throat.
I throw up everything in my stomach.
Everything I ate, my gastric juices; I throw it all up
and sob.
<Page9>
There's nothing left in my stomach.
And yet my body keeps on dry heaving, as through to
reject everything that's happened here. As if it's
trying to somehow wipe this all away and return the
world to normal.
<Page10>
"――――."
It hurts.
It stings as though my insides are on fire.
I can't stop crying and my body crumples to the ground
like a piece of discarded garbage.
<Page11>
My body has been dyed a sticky red.
There's so much pain, so much red, that I feel like I'm
dreaming.
<Page12>
My tears won't stop.
I'm distraught at the thought of having killed her.
...No, that's not it.
I'm distraught at the fact that I killed her as easily
as if I were dismembering a doll. Without meaning,
without mercy.
<Page13>
―――I just don't understand.
I don't know what came over me.
I don't know why I killed her for no reason,
I don't understand why.
<Page14>
"――――It's a lie."
It has to be. None of this feels real.
I mean, think about it. I had one of my usual dizzy
spells, and then...
All this is just a dream I saw while I was
lightheaded―――
<Page15>
"――――It's a lie."
I mean, how could it be possible to tear a person apart
like that with nothing but a knife?
I've heard that it takes an entire day of hard work to
dismember a single human being, even with a saw.
<Page16>
There's no way you could manage it with nothing more
than a knife.
Plus, those 'lines' aren't even real to begin with.
They're just a convenient delusion that I came up
with――――
<Page17>
"――――It's a lie."
Gastric juices drip from my lips.
Not only my mouth, but my body from the chin down is
sticky with stomach fluids.
The gastric juices blend with the crimson.
My stomach contracts, even though there's nothing left
in it anymore. My esophagus and throat are bleeding.
<Page18>
"It... hurts―――"
It hurts.
That's why I'm sure.
This isn't a dream; I'm just lying to myself.
<Page19>
"―――Everything... is all a lie."
Deep down, I understand that.
I was lusting after her. Seeing that woman made me
aroused.
<Page20>
The same goes for my eyes.
I already understood that these 'lines' let me cut
through things as easily as slicing paper.
Tohno Shiki should have known that humans could be torn
apart just as easily.
I'd been living irresponsibly, not even stopping to
consider that possibility.
<Page21>
...I can kill things so easily. I'm a dangerous human
being.
I should have blinded myself, or endeavored to live a
life where I'd never see another soul.
<Page22>
"...I'm sorry, Sensei."
―――I'm so sorry.
I couldn't even keep such a simple promise――――
<Page23>
"Am I―――still sane?"
I don't know. Not even a speck of the impulses that
overcame me earlier remains.
<Page24>
But at that time, I didn't even think about enduring or
suppressing those thoughts.
"Kill that woman."
I was thinking and acting as though such impulses were
totally natural.
<Page25>
Then... the answer is simple.
I've definitely gone crazy.
I've probably been crazy for the last seven years.
Ever since the accident that should have killed me.
From the moment I miraculously survived―――――――
