<Page1>
That's right, I should go swing by the tea ceremony
room.
Apparently, Ciel-senpai came by to visit me this
morning, so there's a chance I might be able to run
into her if I head there.
<Page2>
"But, before I do..."
It's bad form to show up empty-handed. I'll take a
little detour.
<Page3>
It took me longer than I expected to get the necessary
supplies.
I knock on the door of the tea ceremony room.
After a few moments, the door opens and Senpai pokes
her head out.
<Page4>
"Oh, if it isn't Tohno-kun."
Senpai cocks her head to the side, puzzled.
<Page5>
"Senpai. Would you like to have lunch with me?"
"Lunch?
I appreciate the offer Tohno-kun, but―――"
<Page6>
This doesn't look good.
Senpai seems to be on the fence about whether to accept
my invitation or not. I wonder if she has other things
she needs to take care of.
Well, I have a little trick up my sleeve for this exact
situation.
<Page7>
"Did I mention that I brought curry buns?"
"Huh―――?"
<Page8>
Senpai's expression brightens visibly.
...What the hell. I mean no disrespect when I say that
that's  cute...
<Page9>
"What do you think? I'll give you these as thanks for
yesterday's lunch, so why don't we eat together?"
<Page10>
"O-Oh, that's very kind, thank you.
...Alright then. If this is just thanks for yesterday,
then there's no reason for me to refuse."
Fidgeting with her glasses, Senpai steps aside and lets
me enter the tea ceremony room.
<Page11>
"Please make yourself comfortable.
I was just in the middle of brewing some tea."
<Page12>
Senpai steps into the next room.
I guess that's the kitchenette.
<Page13>
"Ah..."
As I enter the tea ceremony room, it becomes clear why
Senpai was hesitating earlier.
There is an empty lunch box on the tatami mat.
It seems that she has already eaten lunch.
<Page14>
"Tohno-kun, would you like green tea or black tea?"
"Green tea, please.
More importantly, Senpai, did you eat lunch already?"
<Page15>
"Yes, not long before you showed up. I overslept today,
so I didn't get to eat breakfast. My stomach was
grumbling at me all morning."
<Page16>
"...I see. I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
I'll go eat in class and leave you in peace."
<Page17>
"Huh―――you're not going to give me any curry bread?"
Senpai is suddenly standing in the doorway of the
kitchenette. The expression on her face is that of a
child who didn't receive any presents for Christmas.
<Page18>
"Well, I mean... you're full, aren't you, Senpai?"
"Not at all. I'm starving."
<Page19>
An instantaneous response.
...It's pretty clear what she's most concerned about
here.
<Page20>
"Well, if you insist. But are you sure, Senpai?
These curry buns are pretty big, don't you think?"
"Don't worry about it. If it's something I like,
there's no limit to what I can eat."
<Page21>
I already figured that out yesterday.
That bashful smile of hers isn't out of embarrassment
over having a second helping of lunch. She's just
genuinely excited about the thought of eating that
curry bread.
<Page22>
"........."
...She's an enigma.
In this day and age, it's rare to find someone who can
get  excited over a simple curry bun.
<Page23>
After Senpai ate a curry bun, and I ate two, we decided
to have some tea to wash them down.
I sit down on the tatami mat and leisurely enjoy a cup
of tea with her.
<Page24>
"By the way, I saw the news this morning.
Tohno-kun, is everything alright at your new home? It
seemed like something serious happened..."
<Page25>
"The news?"
...Ah, I remember Hisui mentioning that the police had
come over to ask questions about those bloodstains.
<Page26>
"The stuff on the news had nothing to do with us. As
for my impressions of the mansion itself, the inside is
quite magnificent but there are stray dogs that make a
racket at night.
If I had to complain, I'd say that it's let down by not
having a TV or a Japanese-style room. There isn't
really a place where you can just enjoy a mug of tea
like this."
<Page27>
"Stray dogs? What are you talking about? Wasn't the
incident in front of your mansion part of those serial
killings?"
"No way, there'd have been much more of a commotion if
it were.
There was nothing criminal, just some bloodstains.
...Well, except―――"
<Page28>
They found the bloodstains in the same spot where I
went to look for the dogs last night... I can't say
that out loud.
<Page29>
"No, it's just a misunderstanding. Whatever it is, it
has nothing to do with us. I don't often get to relax
with you like this, so why don't we talk about
something a little more pleasant."
<Page30>
"What do you mean it has nothing to do with you! You
live in the same city that the serial killings are
occurring in, so I think that merits at least a little
attention. Tohno-kun, I feel like you lack a sense of
danger!"
Senpai's tone has become a little heated.
She is the very image of a reliable upperclassman
scolding an unscrupulous junior.
<Page31>
"Sure, but it's only dangerous if you're out and about
at night, right?
Besides, there have been eight victims already, so the
police will probably catch the culprit soon."
<Page32>
"Come on. If you keep thinking that way, you'll get
attacked while your guard is down.
The news has been saying the same thing since the third
victim was discovered, but they still haven't caught
the culprit yet, have they?"
<Page33>
...She's right about that.
For a string of serial killings to continue this long
in modern Japan is beyond abnormal. It's practically
bordering on paranormal.
<Page34>
"...You're right. I didn't really take it seriously
after I saw the news banner calling it the work of a
'modern-day vampire'... I suppose that was careless of
me. I live here, so I should probably be a bit more
careful."
<Page35>
"Yes. As long as you understand, it's alright.
Seriously, don't go running off with anyone you don't
know. If the culprit  some psycho who enjoys being
treated as a vampire, you might look like easy prey.#
You give off the impression that you might be a
delicacy for some reason."
"...No, um, Senpai? I'm not sure if that's a good
comparison."
<Page36>
I'd rather she didn't tempt fate by saying things like
that.
Though, I have chronic anemia, so I'm probably not a
good target for vampires in the first place.
<Page37>
"But if you think about it, it doesn't add up, does it?
They call the killer a vampire, but I wonder why they
chose that nickname."
"Hmm? The bodies were entirely drained of blood,
weren't they? Doesn't that make a vampire a pretty
fitting metaphor?"
<Page38>
"...I'm not so sure. Isn't it generally accepted that
people who have their blood sucked by vampires become
vampires as well?
But the bodies of all the victims are still here, they
aren't off wandering around as vampires. There was no
need to go and cook up a ghoulish nickname, just call
it a murder."
<Page39>
"Tohno-kun, do you really believe that vampires exist?"
"...Listen here. I just went along with it because
that's what the news is saying. If it really was the
work of a vampire there wouldn't be any bodies left
behind, like I said."
<Page40>
"That's true. But can't you also think of it this way?
The corpses that have been found were people that died
because they  become vampires.
There are two types of people: those who can become
vampires and those who cannot. If a person who 
become a vampire is attacked, their body will never be
found. Instead, they'd still be out there somewhere,
living in secret."
<Page41>
". That's a horror story, isn't it, Senpai?"
"Yes, it's more a horror story than anything else.
Unfortunately, we have not reached the ending."
<Page42>
With a smile, Senpai sips her tea.
While we were idly chatting away, lunch break came to
an end.
<Page43>
Senpai said she still had some things to clean up, so I
go out into the hallway ahead of her.
Accepting her kindness, I turn away from the tea
ceremony room and start to head back to my classroom
when suddenly―――
<Page44>
"Oh my, is that you, Shiki-kun?
I'm surprised to see you in a place like this."
I unexpectedly bump into Noel-sensei.
<Page45>
Noel-sensei is holding a silver accessory in her right
hand.
It looks like... a cross.
<Page46>
"Ah, this? I told you, right? I'm doing this little
side job to keep myself busy.
The other wing of the school is too noisy, so I came
here to the club building to perform my daily prayers.
Anyway, what are you doing here?# Do you have a secret
meeting place around here by any chance?"
<Page47>
"Huh... no, that's―――"
I can't tell her I just came here to visit my
upperclassman in the tea ceremony club.
<Page48>
"No, I was simply walking around to take my mind off
things.
I haven't had lunch yet, so I was thinking of heading
back to the cafeteria."
I try to act natural, and keep my response as vague as
possible.
<Page49>
"My, my. Taking a little stroll before your meal.
You're like a college student with too much time on
their hands. Shiki-kun, are you aiming for a music
college or something?"
"No, I'm not interested in music... why do you ask?"
<Page50>
"Hmm,# I was just curious!
Okay then, bye-bye! To the cafeteria you go, hurry up
or lunch break will be over ☆!"
<Page51>
'See you later', adds Noel-sensei with a wink, and then
softly presses her lips to the silver accessory in her
hand.

shoes disappears into the back of the club building.
