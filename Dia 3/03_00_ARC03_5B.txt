...I watch the crowd in front of the station in a daze.
It's a little past two.
The bustle of the city continues unabated.
People are passing by me in droves.
Each and every one of them is a perfect stranger to me,
and they don't even spare a glance toward those around
them as they each make for their own destinations.
<Page2>
Despite all these people being in the same place, they
are each locked in their own separate worlds.
In the same way that you are the main character in your
own life―――
They go about each day with themselves at center stage.
<Page3>
Even as they look around themselves, they see nothing
at all.
Their respective days do not intersect, nor do they
branch off in new directions.
<Page4>
This is the insight that allows us to obtain a baseline
level of public order with a minimum amount of effort.
Even while depending on others, we don't get too
involved with them. This kind of individualism seems to
be the path chosen by mankind.
<Page5>
"........."
Perhaps I'm feeling sentimental because of the light
fever.
"...Time to go home."
I feel a lot calmer now, and if I hang around here I'll
only end up wallowing in these worthless thoughts.
<Page6>
I stand up from the bench and blend in with the crowd.
With my thoughts dulled by anemia, I head for the
mansion.
All I want right now is to be left alone in my room. I
want to take off my glasses, close my eyes, and become
nothing but a pair of lungs.
@g―――That is, until I crossed paths with that woman.
<Page7>
"――――――"
@gI even wondered whether time itself had stopped.
@gEvery fiber of my being commits that instant to
memory.
<Page8>
@g―――.
@gGolden hair and red eyes.
@gWhite clothes. A white figure.
@gA snowfield with no footprints.
@gAn unblemished silhouette, reminiscent of a sacred
mountain beyond human comprehension.
<Page9>
@g―――Ba-dump.
@gMy pulse skyrockets.
@gMy heart kicks into overdrive.
@gMy veins and arteries are invigorated.
@gMy nerves snap one by one under the stress, as though
someone had put a torch to my spinal cord.
<Page10>
@gTo say that I'm entranced would understate my
obsession.
@gMy feet are already stopping.
@gI turn my head so as not to lose sight of her as she
passes by me.
<Page11>
"――――――――――――"
@gI find myself forgetting to breathe.
@gI feel nauseous.
@gI can't breathe.
@gI'm suffocating.
@gI can't remember how to breathe properly no matter
how hard I try.
<Page12>
"――――――――――――"
@gMy throat is burning.
@gMy eyeballs feel like they're going to shatter.
@gMy palms are wet and slippery.
@gMy blood isn't doing its job and my fingertips are so
cold that I can't even feel them, but even so―――
@gI'm sweating so much.
<Page13>
@gI remember that I am a living thing.
@gMy body begins to breathe again.
@gBut my sense of reason――――
<Page14>
         I didn't make any mistakes.
         I didn't choose anything.
         I just wanted to go home.
<Page15>
@gMy sense of reason is―――
@gI vaguely understand now that the tightrope I tricked
myself into walking has been cut.
<Page16>
"―――――――――――――"
@g...I have to chase her.
@gI have to chase that woman.
@gChase, chase, chase, and then talk.
@gI move my frozen feet.
@gBreathing as hotly and heavily as a ■■■■―――
@gI hunt the figure of the <woman|p r e y  > in white.
<Page17>
"――――――――――――"
@gThe woman is walking slowly.
@gShe's not interested in me at all.
@g―――A faint question crosses my mind.
@gNot interested? That's absurd. Is she really that
sort of person? But the truth is, she hasn't even
noticed me. Did something happen? There must have been
something. She's probably very tired. Exhausted.
Drained. That's why I have an opportunity. The reason I
feel this way is because, when all is said and done,
I'm confident that /I can ■ her/.

@gI'm not talking about a desire that can be satisfied
through masturbation or intercourse. I mean something

@gI don't even remember ever having satisfied it at
all.
<Page19>
@g'Haa'. I let out a sigh that doesn't sound like my
own.
@gI clutch my chest to hold back my boiling emotions.
@gThe woman swimming through the crowd is so chastely
beautiful that I could just eat her up.
<Page20>
"―――――――"
@gMy THROAT is ACHING.
@gI haven't been ABLE to BREATHE for a WHILE now.
@gBut what of it? It's only natural.
@gIt would be rude of me as a living being not to get
excited after witnessing such ■.
<Page21>
@gI take something out of my bag.
@gI put it in my pocket and start to walk.
@gI feel the hard touch of iron on my fingertips.
@gI am truly blessed.
@gThis tool is just perfect.
<Page22>
@gHow wonderful. I'm going to climax. What a sensual
rendezvous.
@gI need to keep my distance.
@gI can't let her notice me.
@gI can't let any of the nuisances that surround me get
suspicious.
@gThat woman and I are complete strangers.
@gI have to follow her by scent alone, acting as
naturally as I'm capable of.
<Page23>
@gThe woman enters an apartment complex.
@gAn automatic glass door. The security is perfect.
@gYou can't even enter the lobby if you aren't a
resident.
@gI go around to the emergency exit, take off my
jacket, and leave it somewhere hidden. I cut. I go
inside.
<Page24>
@gThere's no one in the lobby.
@gI look at the elevator. The light is stopped at the
top floor.
<Page25>
"――――――"
@gI press the call button. I go inside.
<Page26>
@gI'm immediately overwhelmed by the traces of her
presence.
@gThe lingering scent of that woman makes the corners
of my mouth twitch upwards.
<Page27>
@gI'm trembling with excitement.
@gIn the tight confines of this sealed room, I clutch
the weapon in my pocket.
@gShe's right here, near me.
@gJust a little further and I can ■ her.
<Page28>
@gI get out of the elevator.
@gI could sense that there was no one on the landing.
@gI leave the sealed room. I cross to the hallway.
There's not a soul in sight.
@gI can't think.
@gMy brain can only think of a single word.
<Page29>
@g■ that woman.
@gTo ■ that woman.
@gAt this rate, I'm going to――――――
<Page30>
@g―――I've arrived in front of room three.
@gThis must be it. All of the other rooms are empty.
Can I be sure? I can. If you live as an animal, you can
tell that much by smell whether you want to or not.
It's shameful. It's unforgivable. There's nothing I can
do about it. The rules of modern society are fragile
things. That's why even such a trivial impulse is
enough to prove fatal to them.
<Page31>
"―――――――――"
@gI go to press the doorbell, but stop.
@gMy glasses are in the way.
@gI can't do what I came here for with these on.
<Page32>
"―――Got it?
Don't ever look at things thoughtlessly, okay?"
<Page33>
"......"
@gThere was a woman who told me that a long time ago.
@gBut now I can't remember her name or her face.
<Page34>
@gI slowly take off my glasses.
@gThe squirming lines look like the wrinkles of age.
<Page35>
@gI don't even understand it myself.
@gWhat am I trying to accomplish?
@gWhy have I come all this way?
@gWhat does Tohno Shiki... want to do with that woman
from earlier?
<Page36>
@gI don't know.
@gI don't know, but I press the doorbell.
<Page37>
"Yes―――"
@gI hear a voice through the door. The door begins to
open.
@gIn that moment.
@gI slip into the room through the small gap.
<Page38>
"Huh――――"
@gThe woman cries out.
@gAt least, she tries to.
@gThe voice of the woman I was so infatuated with, who
I had desperately pursued all the way here, will never
be heard again.
@gThe whole thing is over before I know it.
<Page39>
@gThe moment I enter the room, I hear a click. The
sound of a hammer striking.
@gWas it the sound of the door? The creaking of my
brain? The alarm bells of the end?
@gIt wasn't any of those things. So then, what was it?
@gIt goes without saying. There's only one thing it
could be.
@gThe sound of a knife being released.
<Page40>
@gIn an instant, I trace the lines running along the
woman's body.
@gI stab.
@gI cut.
@gI pierce.
@gI run her through.
@gI cut her into pieces.
@gI kill her, completely and utterly.
<Page41>
@gThere are a total of seventeen lines on her body.
@gNeck, back of the head, right eye to lip, upper right
arm, lower right arm, right ring finger, left elbow,
left thumb, middle finger, left breast, ribs to heart,
stomach to the abdomen in two places, left groin, left
thigh, left shin, left toe.
@gAs we pass by each other, in the space of less than a
second―――
@gI run through them all in the blink of an eye.
@gI dismantle her into seventeen cuts of meat.
<Page42>
"―――Huh?"
I hear a stupid, idiotic voice.
I don't even realize that it came from my own mouth.
<Page43>
I feel lightheaded and dizzy.
There are pieces of something scattered in front of me.
A red liquid seeps across the marble floor, as though
someone had knocked over a bucket of water.
The revolting smell of blood.
The cuts are very clean. There are no organs spilling
out.
<Page44>
There is only that crimson color, sweeping across the
floor like a wave.
It's a strange sight.
The room is empty save for the dismembered woman's
limbs and myself, just standing there.
<Page45>
"―――What the―――"
The creeping red color is too vivid.
The knife used to commit this murder is still clutched
in my hand.
<Page46>
"She's―――dead."
Of course she is.
She wouldn't be human if she were still alive after
this.
<Page47>
"Wh―――y?"
There's nothing, nothing at all.
Just now, with my very own hands.
Did Tohno Shiki really cut this woman he didn't even
know to pieces, with his own hands, like it was
nothing?
<Page48>
"Did I―――kill her?"
There's no doubt about it.
Or maybe there is?
I had no reason to. No, it can't have been me. But
reason never even entered into this to begin with. No,
it can't have been me. I'm the only one here. There was
another person here up until a moment ago, but now I'm
the only one alive. No. It can't have been me. But I
had no reason, there was no reason to, I didn't want
to, I wasn't, I wasn't in my right mind. I was never
sane in the first place. No, it can't, it can't have
been me, it wasn't―――
<Page49>
―――The red blood continues to spread across the
marble floor.
Oozing slowly.
It makes it all the way to my feet.
<Page50>
".........Ah."
I lift my shoes in surprise, but not in time.
Ropes of the woman's red blood stretch between my feet
and the floor like coal tar.
<Page51>
'―――――――'
. I-It's, blood.
Because I broke her apart, that disgusting color
continues to sluggishly flow out of her and spread
messily across the floor.
<Page52>
"―――It wasn't me."
Yes, this has to be a mistake.
A mistake. A mistake. It has to be a mistake, it  to
be.
This must be―――
C:> This must be some kind of a bad dream.
C:> ...No, this is a reality wrought by my own hands.
