After finishing my lunch in the cafeteria, I return to
the classroom.
Since there's still some time before fifth period, the
only people left in the classroom are a smattering of
boys and close-knit groups of girls.

"......Huh?#"
I just realized something.
I don't see Yumizuka Satsuki among the girls.
She's the most... well, maybe the third most
eye-catching girl in the class. Her not being here is
enough to make me feel a little uneasy.

"...I wonder if she's out today."
I didn't even notice until lunchtime, so I guess I'm
pretty out of it myself.
The new homeroom teacher didn't mention anything, so
she's probably just out sick today.
