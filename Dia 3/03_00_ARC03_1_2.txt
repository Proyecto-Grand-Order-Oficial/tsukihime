"Good morning, Kohaku-san. It's a beautiful morning,
isn't it?"
"Yes, good morning, Shiki-san."
<Page2>
Kohaku-san returns my greeting with a big smile on her
face.
<Page3>
"Did you sleep well last night?
I was worried that you might be uncomfortable spending
the night in an unfamiliar mansion."
<Page4>
"Not at all, it took me a minute to acclimate to the
ceilings being so high, but after that I was fine. I
used to live here after all, plus now I have you here
to take care of me."
"Oh my. You're quite the smooth talker, Shiki-san."
"No, no. It's a fact."
<Page5>
Kohaku-san and I exchange some friendly words.
It's only been a few days, but I feel I've gotten to
know her quite well.
I'm not especially good with people or anything. Maybe
it's just the power of her smile?
―――However.
<Page6>
I notice that another set of eyes has been staring at
me this whole time.
"Oh, cra―――#Hi."
I give her a casual wave as I greet her.
Akiha is staring―――no,  at me.
<Page7>
"'Oh cra――', is not a customary greeting, Nii-san.
I wonder if there's any more to that phrase."
"Nope. There's definitely no more to it."
I answer immediately, without batting an eyelid. In
fact, I couldn't bat them even if I tried―――my whole
face is frozen with apprehension.
<Page8>
"Good morning, Akiha. Lovely weather this morning,
huh?"
<Page9>
"Oh, you do not have to force yourself to greet me.
Please feel free to ignore me. It seems you'd prefer to
enjoy your morning together with Kohaku.
Ah, since you get along so well, would you like to be
her valet? I would not mind that at all."
<Page10>
"...Full throttle first thing in the morning, huh?"
My sister's scathing remarks are truly formidable.
I guess that as her brother, I probably should've
greeted her first...
<Page11>
"Akiha-sama, please don't tease Shiki-san too much. He
doesn't have much time and he hasn't eaten breakfast
yet."
<Page12>
"The reason he hasn't had breakfast yet is because he
woke up late. It's his own fault that his mornings are
so rushed."
Akiha exhales haughtily.
It seems she's spent the entire time silently fuming
about my tardy arrival.
<Page13>
"Kohaku-san. Is my breakfast ready by any chance?"
"Yes, it's all set. If you give the word, I can prepare
your meal right away."
<Page14>
"I'm afraid that won't do, Kohaku. Just look how late
it's gotten―――Nii-san doesn't have time to spare for
breakfast. He'll be late for school."
<Page15>
"No, no, no. It's just turned seven, I have plenty of
time.
It only takes around half an hour to walk to school
from here."
"In other words, you barely have ten minutes to eat
breakfast? You are not a starving dog, you should take
your time with a meal."
<Page16>
" ―――"
She calls out my inadequacies with pinpoint
precision... I have no choice but to acknowledge her
formidable quick wit and supernatural reflexes.
She's just like a flat wall constantly repelling the
ball during tennis practice. I'm not going to say which
part is the wall though.
<Page17>
"...Nii-san.
Were you about to say something strange just now?"
"No, nothing. Really, nothing.
Besides, what did you mean by 'I'm not a dog',
Akiha―――"
<Page18>
Actually, that reminds me.
Speaking of dogs, I need to ask about what happened
last night.
