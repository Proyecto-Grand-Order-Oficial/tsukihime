I make it to class with only a few minutes to spare
before homeroom starts.
I'm not used to my new route yet, so I guess I didn't
leave myself enough time.
The time for idle morning chatter is coming to a close,
and most of the students have returned to their desks.
<Page2>
With this as a backdrop―――
".... You sure arrived with plenty of time to
spare, didn't you?"
Arihiko is about to take his seat, a dejected look on
his face. ...It seems like he actually plans on taking
class seriously today.
<Page3>
"Good morning. You don't seem all that motivated
today―――# No, I take that back. You're actually in
class for once. What's wrong, you not feeling well?"
<Page4>
"Oh, I was pretty energetic up until a few moments ago.
Raring to go, even. After all, Senpai had come to grace
us with her presence."
"By Senpai, do you mean Ciel-senpai?"
<Page5>
"That's right. Buuut, after she found out 
wasn't here, she didn't seem to be in the mood anymore
and went back to her own classroom. Why'd you have to
choose today of all days to show up at the last minute,
Tohno?"
<Page6>
So that's what happened... If I'd known Senpai was
here, I'd have come running.
<Page7>
"Sorry about that. Still, if we're lucky we might be
able to meet up with her at lunch. It's not like that
was our last chance to ever see her again."
"Well of course it isn't.
If that was the last chance I ever had to see her, I'd
be way too shocked to be sitting here in class."
<Page8>
Heading for my desk, I wave an indifferent 'oh, really'
in his direction.
Right as I'm sitting down, the bell rings and
Noel-sensei enters the classroom.
<Page9>
"Hiii, Goood Mornin'!
I'm glad to see everyone's in good shape... Wait,# oh
no, looks like two students are out. Well, I suppose
the seasons are changing.
I wonder if they got careless and caught a cold?"
<Page10>
Noel-sensei starts taking attendance.
One male student and one female student are absent.
As I'm trying to remember who those two empty seats
belong to―――
I happen to make eye contact with her.
<Page11>
"―――Ah."
I look away, flustered.
...It's strange, I'm sure it's just my imagination, but
it feels as though Noel-sensei spends a lot of time
looking in my direction.
